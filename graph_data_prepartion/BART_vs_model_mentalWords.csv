"The last times 4- 5 years ago I tried to start a stimulant med Adderall and Ritalin , I'd last about two days before feeling extremely suicidal. I had my partner drive me to the ER the last time it happened, it was so bad. I'm really feeling like meds would benefit me greatly, but I'm too afraid of that happening again.

"Two months ago my girlfriend of 2.5 years left me, essentially for someone else, at least because of someone else. She was the only thing I cared about, she got me through two years of university and I would have probably killed myself otherwise. I don't know. I don't care about anything in life and never had, she was the only thing that made life worth living, tough situations worth getting through and ever since she left me my depression progressed to ""crippling"". It's not great. I'm quite a misanthrope. I always was but ever since meeting her I began to hate people even more because she was so amazing while everyone else sucked so much. Anyway, to the main point. Sorry for rambling. I know that the only thing that could make me feel better or take my mind off it is if I found someone else. The loneliness is suffocating and I really need someone to talk to, someone to just hug me or something. But it's impossible for me to date. Because of the new level of severity of my depression I became so dull, so empty. I don't have anything that I want to talk about and I don't care what others have to say. I used to be able to at least make jokes all the time before, I'm not saying they were great, and they were usually really dark, but I could make people laugh. I can't even do that now. I realize that I have no value as a potential romantic partner and other people are so boring and shitty in my eyes. It seems that I'm in a predicament that has no way out and it's entirely my fault.

"Background on her 22 years old, undiagnosed, but has mentioned she thinks she has it and all of the symptoms of BPD on every webpage match up to her. My mother, when she was alive, was a doctor, and left behind medical knowledge and textbooks for me and my brother. I'm not playing armchair psychologist - she is 100 Borderline, with Histrionic traits. Her mother may be BPD, but she is absolutely NPD. She apparently was on medication and was normal for a short period, but stopped taking her medication because apparently her job as a nurse wouldn't allow it. Her mother is a fucking monster. She has reached the point of no return. My girlfriend hasn't seen her grandmother in her 50s ever, because she is like her mother and left her illness untreated, and now lives in a psychiatric ward. She refuses contact from her family, and according to my girlfriend, only one person knows where she is. My girlfriend's mother got pregnant with her at 16. Her biological father is out of the picture. She was raised by a man who has since estranged both her mother and my girlfriend due to their behaviors. She has no one besides me and my family, and a few ""friends"". Her mother was, and still is, a complete monster. She beat my girlfriend and her brother and was physically abusive to her ""step""dad they never married, she had an episode when he proposed to her, then they broke up . She was absolutely horrible to my girlfriend during childhood. She has long lasting scars and still cannot tell me everything. She would say horrible things to her, the worst of which being ""I WISH I ABORTED YOU"", forced her to get a job to pay bills when she turned 16 although her fiance who brought two kids into the house didn't have a job , and kicked her out literally on her 18th birthday. Whenever I would go over to her mother's house with her she insisted I go, as she was afraid to go alone , it always involved her screaming at my girlfriend and her step brothers more on that later , and talking sexually in front of me. On one instance, we were alone in her kitchen and she was smiling and telling me about how her wet suit makes her butt and her thighs look big. It left me very uncomfortable. I haven't seen her since last Christmas, my girlfriend went no contact with her 6 months ago. She saved up 3000 managing a restaurant to take her mother on a carribean cruise, as a last ditch effort to mend their relationship. Her reaction to the gift given last Christmas was horribly depressing - my girlfriend did a huge arts and craft scavenger hunt for her and had a custom- made t- shirt reading ""My daughter's taking me on a carribean cruise! "". Her reaction was as if she was given a pair of socks, or something equally lackluster. My heart sunk. The trip involved my girlfriend getting black out drunk every night due to the horrible shit her mother said and did to her all day every day, and calling me each night crying. They spoke once after that, to try to get her mother to fill out her FASFA, which she refused. Anyway, I'll try to condense her current and recent behaviors to give you an idea of how toxic she is to everyone around her - she got married to a man shortly after her ex- boyfriend my gf's ""real""dad left her, and he brought along two children from a previous marriage. Her husband toured in Iraq and I believe has combat PTSD. His and her behavior combined with the behavior of the kids' biological mom and new step- dad are causing serious trauma for these poor sweet boys. Their dad will call them faggots and gay and won't let them grow their hair out, because he is an unironic homophobe read human piece of shit , and once told one of the boys to ""just show him your dick"", in regards to him being friendly with my father at my gf's graduation party. My girlfriend's mom will have episodes in front of them and will scream ""I JUST WANT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF""right in front of them. They're engaged in a custody dispute with the kids' biological mom who she calls a witch and other names IN FRONT OF THE WOMAN'S SONS , and this has led her to use the children as weapons against her husband's ex wife and new husband who wouldn't let the boys take spanish because he hates Mexicans. these kids don't belong in either household. , and this has resulted in her moving the kids into a 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom house in the suburbs, as a crutch to win the custody dispute. Her and her husband make 60k a year, and I've computed that there is no way they could afford this house. Alas, her mom is now hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and these kids are still suffering. In short her mother's NPD fucked up her life, continues to do so, and now she is redirecting her mental illness on two sweet 11 year old boys. Now, onto our relationship started dating when I was 16, she was 18. Now 20 and 22. I noticed red flags early pathological jealousy, showing up at my house, irrational fits of anger, etc., but was willing to overlook them because I was sympathetic to her situation, and I was dealing with my own shit - c- PTSD from severe domestic violence, including two attempted murders, and witnessing my mother's graphic overdose death at the age of 16. However, over time, her illness worsened. I was hospitalized twice over the course of three years for suicide attempts. I became dominated by her abuse. She would scream at me almost every day , call me names piece of shit, asshole, prick, retard , isolate me from friends and family, and after 2 years became physically abusive - hitting me, slapping me, throwing hard objects at me, twisting my fingers back, etc. The past few days, she had another mental breakdown. I went to hang out with a girl I've been friends with for 4 years who she has seen and knows about , and she went completely off the walls. She was screaming at me, cussing, etc. and I went anyway. She sent me 20 messages in the hour I spent with my friend, in which one of my gf's friends showed up and sat behind us could be coincidence , and she ended up stalking her, messaging her and another girl with the same name on Facebook, going on a belligerent rant, and messaging multiple people to find out who she was, and her sexual orientation, as I'd noted she just got out of a lesbian relationship. When I got home, she was in hysterics. She was all dolled up and told me she was going out with some guys. I said okay. She started screaming and cussing at me again and told her I wasn't going to talk to her when she's like this, and I tried to leave and she physically blocked me from leaving the room. It took about 15 minutes of her screaming at me and telling me to put my hands on her for me to be able to get out of the room. When I left, she screamed that she was leaving me, she wishes she never met me, she hates me, fuck you, and that she wants to kill herself. I hid all the knives in the house. The next day, she went to school, collapsed in the counselor's office and told them she was suicidal, and went to comm care for 4 hours and lied her way from being admitted to psych. She came home and I haven't talked to her, but she's now at her job a Hooters style restaurant . I have decided now that I need to break up with her because she is in denial of her illness and is refusing to get treatment, and is becoming more and more abusive and violent by the day. There are a lot of problems with me doing so. First and foremost, I'm terrified of her committing suicide, or hurting someone else. Secondly, she has absolutely no one, no place to stay, no money. She wastes her money cruise, school she should not be attending because she needs treatment first, 1k on a personal trainer 8 week program that she never followed up on, etc. and she is 22 and is still driving my spare car. I am all she has right now and I am seriously terrified of what will happen if I break up with her. I just can't take the abuse anymore. I've gotten myself into some shit that's going to take some time to untangle. I want to help her and I want her to be okay but I have to get out, I just can't take it anymore.

"My friend 20F has suffered from depression, anxiety, and bpd for many years. When we first became friends, we grew close partially due to her feeling comfortable talking to me about her mental health. At the time, being younger, I had never heard of things like ""mental health""or even ""therapy"".Since then I have had my own experiences of depression and anxiety, being able to actually notice and identify them as such as I learned about psychology, even as far as majoring in it. Fortunately, that has allowed me to relate to understand my friend more as she confides in me regarding mental health. That has helped me in being there for her as I am able to understand clearer how such illnesses affect an individual. But lately, and for a while, have felt that when she comes to me I'm asking several questions and using her responses to come up with some idea of how to improve her mental health e.g. exercise, lower weed and nicotine intake and turning this into my responses. But I understand that when people come to you there not necessarily looking for advice or a plan. That's just where my mind goes there's a problem, so we do something to fix it by coming up with some kinda plan. Even with having experienced such illnesses, though not to the same extent, I find it hard to put myself in her shoes in order to see what she needs. Because of that, I don't know what to ""give""her when she comes to me. So my questions are What kind of things am I supposed to say? What does she need from me exactly? How can I fulfill that need?

"Hello, first time posting here. I thought I'd share here since I don't really have anyone I can talk to this about atm. So I am not very shy about using vulgar language. My mother, on the other hand, absolutely hates it. She especially gets mad at me for using 'piss' and as I found out today 'cunt'. She berated me for not being more feminine.

""Ah, yes, because when you look at me you see a princess.""This is why you're a disappointment.""Now, I have trouble telling if people are joking with me even when it is obvious theyre joking. At least in those situations I can laugh along and be like ""Youre kidding, right?""I was not able to detect anything to suggest this was a joke. There was nothing in her voice that denoted sarcasm and she had her back turned away from me as she said it. My sister and my cousin were laughing, but that felt less of there being a joke and more like mocking. Naturally, I got upset. Cursed her out and holed myself up in my room for an hour before she barged in and started at me. ""Are you going to sit in here all day sulking! ? You know I was joking!

"Its Day 3 and the anxiety is really starting to kick in. But Ive made the choice to face it, sit with it, and make friends with it. This is what I learned about myself. One of the comforts I got from THC was having a scapegoat rather than taking responsibility for myself. But its hard to explain because its not like I would get fucked up and go do reckless things. What I mean is more like, if I didnt remember something my boyfriend had told me, I could say, Well, I was probably high so thats why I dont remember where now I have to ask myself, Was I being a good partner and listening? This is a really good thing, but its really scary to confront yourself without your crutch. I worry about other things too like, what if Im just a moody unlikable bitch without THC? The truth is, maybe I am, but if I am, I can make a choice to take responsibility for that aspect of myself and change it.

"My anxiety is at its worst. Recently I went to my boyfriend's friend's house for the first time and I got so nervous that I couldn't even focus on what people were saying to me. I could feel how hot my face was and it was just a very uncomfortable situation for me. Keep in mind, this was not some huge party. There was maybe 6 other people there and everyone was as nice as could be. All I could think about was how I looked, what I sounded like when I spoke, and what people were possibly thinking about me. Rationally, I knew that people weren't judging me and no one was looking at me weird, but it was still impossible for me to enjoy myself. I wasn't always like this though. I was slightly shy when I was younger, but as i got into my early mid teens, I became a very outgoing person who had a lot of friends.

" throwaway account I've always been depressed, most of it stemming from bullying and abuse, and a couple years back it got really severe. I didn't know what I was doing with my life and the life I was leading wasn't turning out the way I wanted it to. Everything just kinda went to shit, and I attempted suicide. Luckily, it failed. And every goddamn day since then I'm relieved that it didn't work. I made the decision that if I was ever going to be happy, I need to start over. I began to tear apart the life I had built for myself and had to start and the very beginning again so far along in life. There were so many times I wanted to give up, and it got really difficult. But I kept going I don't know how but I kept going. There was something about reading my old suicide note that just made me think and encouraged me to write this post. Only a handful of people know I attempted suicide, and I don't plan on telling anyone else. There's something about looking at where you've been and how far you've come. Today I went to my psychologist like I do every week, and I realized that I'm the happiest I've ever been. I still have times where I get depressed and break down, but I don't think I'll ever be 100 okay, and I'm fine with that. And after five years of counselling, six different medications, multiple abusive relationships, an eating disorder, and one suicide attempt later and I sit here typing with a group of supportive, amazing friends and a life that I'm finally happy to be apart of.

"Just a little preface backstory Im 18 and have been dealing with clinical depression and anxiety since I was 16. I did not suffer any trauma in my childhood. I do not live in a bad situation. In fact quite the opposite, Im by no means rich or even upper middle class, but my quality of life is high. Although my parents are divorced, they both love me and are present in my life. I have a great role model in my brother. Im not at all trying to brag, but Im also very smart, though I lack the focus and work ethic to really be successful. I still scored a 1480 on my SAT, but Im struggling hard in college due to not being motivated at all to do any work. Yet, despite all this, I have to take a cocktail of antidepressants and stimulants for ADHD , and I think about killing myself every cursory hour on this miserable Earth. I sit and beat myself up figuratively and literally every day, because I dont know why Im always so tired and miserable. I understand depression and anxiety are chemical imbalances in the brain, and I have no control over it, but that doesnt ever make me feel better. Ive seen different therapists and tried three different antidepressants, but nothing ever helps. I cant help but think its all in my head, and Im just subconsciously and unknowingly craving attention. I understand its dumb to think something like that, and I dont necessarily think its true, but I cant say that the thought doesnt cross my mind very frequently. Im not a control freak, but my largest fear is ignorance, I need to know a cause for everything, even when there may not be one. For example, I suffered from Alopecia two and a half years ago and went completely bald for a year and a half, and I spent every day researching and changing my daily routines to try and understand why I was losing all my hair in patches at 16 years old, and trying to stop it. This caused massive paranoia and anxiety, that I never really healed from. Eventually, my condition cleared for the moment , and I have a full head of hair again thankfully, though this condition is likely to return sometime in the future. During this battle is when my depression really started, and I thought would subside when I felt like a normal kid again, but it never did. Again, I understand you dont necessarily NEED a reason to be depressed, but I cant help but be paranoid and search for a cause every day, but its forever without fruition. Onto the main point of this post and why its in this sub I really only began self harming about 6 months ago. At first, it was shallow, small cuts on my thighs, never to be seen, never to be spoken of. As I got more lonely, I began to want visible scars on my wrists. I dont make an effort to show them off by any means, and I do try to hide them. But in the back of my mind I do want someone that cares to notice them. I do SH as an act of punishment, and usually do it after screwing something up in school or getting really angry at myself for whatever reason, but I cant say that I dont want to leave large scars for people to notice. I have been incredibly lonely my whole life, and I know its disgusting to superficially self harm to get attention, but thats not the whole story for me. I do want the attention, but thats not the only reason, or even the major reason I SH. Im kind of a sadistic bastard, nothing creepy or weird, but I do like the sight of my OWN emphasis on own, again not a psychopath blood. I love the way my scars look, and I even carved 666 into both of my forearms. I dont actually worship Satan lmao, Im an atheist, but I do use the Devil as a symbol for the sin and Darkness that beclouds my lack of a soul. I recently began burning myself, mostly with cigarettes, and I think it leaves an awesome scar. Ive attempted suicide twice. Ive slashed my wrist super deep, and have purposefully overdosed on antidepressants, but both times I called an ambulance before I even passed out. In other words, I pussied out, twice. This makes me even more conflicted and plays more into my notion that I may be a pious attention seeker. Now onto my question Is it so bad that I use my scars as a way to try and get attention? I havent been exposed as no one has seen them, but I sometimes wish they do. If I were only SHing for that purpose which Im not , I would definitely say yes, and trying to justify that its only part of the reason to myself might just make me look like an asshole, and thats why Im here asking, because I honestly have no clue","I do nt know the cause of my depression no matter how hard I try to find it , and I want people to see my SH scars , but the main reason I SH is for self punishment . Am I an attention seeking asshole , or just lonely and want someone to care about me ?

"It's funny that this was a top thread right now. I'm struggling with finding a sponsor or weather or not I even want a sponsor. I've been in out of the program since 2009 and have had 2 sponsors. I have 4 months and some change clean right now not working with anyone. The original pink cloud effect has gone away and I""m becoming restless, irritable, and discontent. I want to get a sponsor but my ability to find someone who is what I'm looking for is hard. Sponsorship nowadays is executed completely wrong IMHO. Most sponsors require you to call them everyday and do all this bullshit that isn't what Bill W had in mind regarding sponsorship. I want someone to guide me through the steps, that's it. I'm a huge Big Book nerd and I feel that all these sponsors that are harsh on their sponsees aren't using an effective approach. Scaring someone straight or forcing them to do things that aren't outlined as suggestions in the Big Book makes it seem like the sponsor is on a power trip, using new comers to feed their spiritual sickness.

"My dad, 65, has been a heavy drinker most of his life, was in the hospital for liver disease back in January. Getting him there was no easy task. He absolutely refused to go. We called paramedics several times but he refused any treatment, even oxygen. He looked so bad I thought that was going to be it, that he could have died at any moment. He would not let them take him to the hospital, and the paramedics said they can't force treatment on someone who is refusing. Finally one night he agreed to let his roommates take him to the ER. They kept him at the hospital for several weeks, told him he had liver disease and that if he didn't stop drinking he wouldn't make it much longer. He wasn't able to walk anymore, and had many health problems, including build up of fluid in his lungs and belly. After about 4- 5 weeks in the regular hospital and then a rehab hospital not a drinking rehab, more like an elderly physical therapy rehab type place he was able to go home. He was set up with a home health nurse who came by once a week, and he stopped drinking! At least he said he did, but I never asked, I never pressured, mostly because I knew it wouldn't do any good and might even make things worse if I got on him about it. Besides, he never stopped in all the years that I've known him, I didn't expect that he would now. He seemed to be doing a lot better. Regained his ability to walk and was making himself food, keeping up with his meds, wanting me to take him on errands, to the store, the bank etc. Seemed like he wanted to try to live. Recently, he developed a hernia and more fluid buildup again. He lives in a house with two active drinkers, I wouldn't be surprised if he is drinking again, but this is the most sober I have seen him almost ever. His liver may be too damaged to recover at this point, I just don't know. I couldn't get a hold of him over father's day, and today got a message from the office reps at the home health place, saying they couldn't get a hold of him to confirm the appointment. I called his house and finally spoke to one of his roommates, they had the phone unplugged because they were getting too many calls! I asked how he's doing, and his roommate said he's not doing so great, has more fluid build up in his belly and says he's not getting enough air he's also a smoker and has asthma . I told them to call the ambulance, but they said he didn't want to go to the hospital. I am getting ready to leave work early to go over there and take him to the hospital myself. Update Just got word that they called the paramedics and he agreed to go to the hospital, so he's on his way there now. I'm heading there as soon as I can get out of work. This is just really stressful, i'm an only child, have a full time job, 2 kids. Its just really a difficult thing to deal with and there isn't much I can do, but try to be there for him I suppose. I am not even sure why i'm writing this, other than to get it out right now. I've already lost my mom, seem most people my age are not having to deal with issues like this with their parents.

"Im 19 year old male with autism, depression and anxiety. Ive struggled for years with dark thoughts and I was doing well until recently. My family owned a restaurant that was our livelihood until it was forced to close in May of last year due to my father, mother , and grandmothers health problems. Since then my dad has sunk into a deep depression as he was the head chef and feels like he failed our family. He was unemployed for months and recently got a new job as a cook with my uncle. However he is to physically sick to work at that new job, and he has threatened to kill himself because he feels worthless. I should also mention that he is likely bipolar although it has never been tested. My mother who is also extremely sickly has dealt with him for years including when he cheated on her is at the end of her rope and is probably going to leave him. On top of all this we cannot afford to continue to live in our house, the house I grew up in and care for a lot, and we are going to move into my grandparents house temporarily until we can find a new home, but that could take months.

Findings were 69.2 of adolescents with high functioning autism expressed desire for a dating relationship. 73.1 with high functioning autism expressed attraction to someone of the opposite sex, and 10.0 to the same sex.

"I was on Latuda with lamictal and 100 stable for several months but Latuda gave me akathesia and I couldnt stand it anymore. I decided I would try to see if I could get by with lamictal monotherapy. I did fine for a while but as its becoming winter and with school really increasing in intensity, I have been having worse and worse mood episodes. I went from what I considered 90 stable to maybe 70 stable now? So pretty much stable, except the the last few episodes have started negatively impacting my life again.

I'm tired and my second alarm is going off in a few minutes. I get out of the bed starting my morning routine consisting of breakfast, anime, and a quick shower before leaving for my buss.

My mind wanders to whatever to something interesting i recently learned and then spirals from one place to another into planning the most efficient plan for death. Like a routine it switches on, feeling nothing. As usual. I arrive to the campus entrance, proceeding to my highschool which lies on the campus.

"I'm a medical school student and I was diagnosed with depression several months ago. I was given Celexa but never filled it and really just wanted to find a therapist before I started medication main reason being there is very little that makes me happy and being intimate with my boyfriend is one of them and was worried about the side effects of the medication. I was told to find a therapist by going through my insurance company and trying various therapists out. I haven't done that, I hardly ever have time at all and I know its an excuse but I have little motivation to do anything. The motivation I have to keep going in medical school is because my fear of people looking down at me and viewing me as weak is one of my largest fears in life. I have an exam tomorrow and I can't study cause all I keep doing is crying and crying and feeling like an idiot cause life is good compared to so many other people but I can't help but feel sad. In the end I know that everything we do is pointless we all die and are whole lives really don't even matter in the scheme of things. I know its a horrible way to think but I think about death a lot. I don't think I would ever kill myself but I think about death a lot. Like crossing the street I think I could just step in front of this car. I could fall in this train track. I could take these pills with alcohol. But I know I wouldn't do it because there is still things that make me happy, although very little. My boyfriend makes me happy but the thing is whenever he is not with me I'm then more unhappy again. It makes me feel week that I depend on him for happiness. I feel so lonely cause he's my only friend and I had friends in the past I'm not sure what happened I lost that somehow in medical school. Every little interaction with every person means so much to me. But I feel in medical school there are always mean people who berate you and make you feel horrible like yourself. I was made to feel very small today and I was treated rudely by an attending which I think just added to the spiral I was already in.

"Life is hard. Lots of people agree on that, but for me, life just seems to hard to be worth it. It's generally not an enjoyable experience. I feel like plate of bad food that I'm being force- fed.

"I'm a tall and skinny 15 year old male with severe anxiety. For two months, I've been having random jabbing pains in the center and left sides of my chest, and aching in my arms, neck, and back. My parents have taken me to the doctor's three times, only to be told every time I was fine. It was only the third time was the decision made by my parents to see a cardiologist. The night these pains suddenly appeared, I immediately consulted Dr. Google about it. This was a HUGE and I can't emphasize enough mistake. Every day for the past two months has been absolute mental torture. I can't focus on my school work, only on my chest and my heartbeat. I am afraid to eat. Sometimes I fear I'm about to have a heart attack at any moment. Other times it's worry about a serious life threatening disease that is only getting worse the longer it's unchecked It doesn't help that anxiety attacks are described very similarly to heart attack . There are so many pointers telling me everything is going to be okay. No family history of heart disease. I'm young. I'm not overweight. It doesn't get worse with exertion or even riding roller coasters. I've never taken a puff off a cigarette, taken a swig of alcohol, or touched a single drug in my life. Despite these pointers, I still go into a well traveled spiral of anxious thinking, until I'm in absolute hysterics, sometimes even certain death is around the corner. I've managed to at least escape Dr. Google, which is good, but my cardiologist appointment is still two weeks away, and my chest pains feel like they've gotten worse in the past few days. I wish my parents understood. I feel so trapped, and I've probably come out of this a major hypochondriac. Does anyone have advice for me?

"I have the same problem. I've heard some research that the idea of planning a lot or telling someone else your goals can actually be counter productive bc the act of it makes you feel productive even though you have realistically done almost nothing. Then you stop once you get the relieving feeling of productivity. This might not be that helpful, but I have made myself stop making lists or at least holding them on this productivity pedestal. I can remember most of the stuff I have to get done, so I either skip the list all together or I quickly jot down the important stuff without letting myself get too ""ah, yes! I am being productive. Now I know what to do""if you know what I mean. I try to channel that energy into just getting started on a task. The 5 min rule is pretty helpful. If you have a big task to do, I tell myself ""just do it for 5 mins.""Some people will say only stick to 5 mins so that next time you do this trick you won't feel like you are lying to yourself and going to end up doing way more, but I think it depends on the person. For me, I do 5 min and then I just want to get that one other part done, then I should do that part too, etc. I end up getting a decent amount done, but I avoided the dread of starting a huge task bc I only planned to do 5 mins.

"I've been in a very happy relationship with my bf for over a year and he's always been great in trying to understand and be helpful during episodes. Typically my episodes are mild and just take time to get past and we've been managing fairly well. Over the last weekend we went to a music festival and I no judgement here please, that's for a different subreddit had a really bad reaction to some mdma I took. My body was dehydrated and malnourished and I nearly landed in the hospital because I took too much than I could sustain. I fortunately was able that night to perk up physically and totally recover from the physical damage. However, I woke up the next morning in an extreme panic attack that has seemingly been in affect ever since. I compulsively monitored my pulse and took my temperature, believed I felt pressure in my chest, I thought I was going to pass out almost all the time, I was convinced I was something was wrong with my heart despite going in and being checked out, I've needed either my boyfriend or roommate by my side 24 7 or I begin to freak out, I missed 4 exams because they were all this week and I only attended one class this week I'm a 14- hour PoliSci student , and I haven't left my apartment. Within the last two days I've gotten rid of the constant sense of dread and no longer feel pain in my chest. I'm coming out of the heightened anxious episode and have now fallen almost directly into a depressive episode. I haven't had an extreme episode like this since high school and it's a big difference from my usual 2 or 3 day depressive episode. After over a week of extreme paranoia and anxiety I'm now pulling myself together and just dealing with being ""down in the dumps""and recovering my grades. Seeing my boyfriend struggle to understand my extreme episode showed me that we desperately need to look further into how to work together in situations like this.

"This is an absolute correct answer for anyone with an allergy or intolerance. Gluten is one that catches many by surprise, but any allergy, especially dietary ones, can be the cause of headaches. As for the anti- gluten people, they're just coming from a perspective than encompasses people other than yourself. Many people demonize it despite not really understanding it. It is no more detrimental to the body than any other dietary protein, but it is one that seems to have a higher incidence of allergy. However, many people use it as a method to lose weight openly or covertly when what is really working for them is the cut in carbohydrates and calories.

"Was just diagnosed with moderate ADHD- PI a few days ago, and I had a loooong reflection on what it took for me to get finally diagnosed. What I needed was Me complaining to an friend I met online just because we found and liked each other's art, which lead to him telling me I might have ADHD symptoms because he was diagnosed with ADHD- PI as a kid Asking a friend from med school to give me tips in weight lifting, who JUST got diagnosed with ADHD a day before, and told me his diagnosis symptoms which suspiciously correlated with mine Both events leading me to talk to my family physician who said I didn't have ADHD because I had enough attention to get into med school and meet a psychiatrist from my university who said I had avoidant personality disorder, which was causing my procrastination, because I had great grades before 12 years old . Both frustrating events leading me to write a whole list of symptoms and my history that I can share with the next medical professional I meet so that they don't immediately disregard my concerns about ADHD. Meeting a counselor at the university, who brought up the idea of meeting a psychologist for a diagnosis which I haven't even thought about as a possibility Meeting a psychologist who didn't dismiss my concerns, and giving me a whole gamut of tests so that we're both sure I had ADHD and not something else. The whole process taking from June to December with my psychologist testing me from October to late November I think if any of those events didn't happen especially meeting my friend the day after his diagnosis of ADHD , I think I could have lived the rest of my life without even thinking ADHD was something I could even have.

"I have been a bit more snippy around everyoneI have a staff member who can't seem to remember anything, or double checks, and I'm tired of answering her when she's been working with us for about a year, to where the one client of the four she has is the only one with dietary restrictions. It's not that she's stupid, she just doesn't really think for herself. She has OCD tendencies, calling continually to make sure she has a ride to work I am her ride on certain days. Another staff is her ride on designated other days We have to tell her to not call until a certain time or she'll start calling texting at 7 in the morning and we don't start work until 3pm! I have to pick her up, and she tends to gab talk when I really need silence when I drive to work. She was the cause of a panic attack because after I asked her to stop talking, she continued to gab. I informed her that this isn't going to work out if she continues both the dutch person where we got her drink at and my lead worker could tell that something is wrong. She was good for the rest of the car ride, but on the way home 8 hours later, she started back up. I'm getting increasingly irritated with her, and now, I've noticed that its leaking towards the guys we work with mentally disabled individuals where I somewhat got on him about him laughing at his peer who was crying the one crying suffers from depression but I feel I laid it on a bit thick. I was working towards 80 hour work weeks, but this past week I worked 48, and will continue to work 48 hours until they hire a new AM worker. I'm fairly certain I'm the reason she quit, as I was pissed that she bought something for herself a dutch energy drink and nothing for the client that she was with.

"The number of close friends I have can be counted on one hand, and they all think that i'm an annoying asshole.

"So my twin sister and I are both juniors in High School currently. Last year during our sophomore year, she got very close with a girl named Claire name changed . Claire and my sister became good friends very quickly, and my sister both are gay, by the way admitted to me much later on that she had actually fallen for Claire. However, when we got back from winter break last year, Claire started acting cold and mean to my sister. She would, according to my sister, just ignore her, be very unfriendly, have only one word answers to my sister's attempts to start conversations, and just generally be a bitch. This sudden change in character hurt my sister deeply, and she started to feel deep anxiety before going to school, to the point where she would feel physically ill and vomit before school important to note that my sister is underweight and has had issues with her stomach her whole life due to complications from a surgery she got as a baby, and in November 2018, just a few months before this all happened, she had gotten surgery for it. When all of this started, we took her to the doctor, who ruled out that she was ill or that anything was physically wrong with her. It became clear very quickly that it was all coming from anxiety in her own head. She missed a significant amount of school because of this, and her grades started to slip as a result. Often, my parents would have to stay home to take care of her, causing them to miss work. However, this is not the whole story. She has admitted to playing up her illnesses in order to stay home from school. Sometimes, it gets so dramatic its crazy. One time last April she collapsed on the floor in a heap unable to communicate with me, because she was in ""so much stomach pain.""Just this Friday, she claimed to have a headache so bad that it rendered her unable to communicate or dress herself, leaving her naked in a fetal position on her bed we took her to the doctor and he said she was fine . It's important to mention here that my sister has been on anxiety medicine and anti depressants, as well as seeing at therapist regularly since 8th grade. When we were younger, my sister claimed to be depressed and anxiety ridden, and would have anxiety attacks and claim to be traumatized whenever my father would yell at us for any reason. However, there were a handful of times where she would use this to get out of things she didn't want to go to, albeit she never used it to get out of school. My main point i'm trying to make here is that she is already on anxiety medicine and seeing a therapist. Over the Summer, I hoped and prayed that things would get better, but it didn't seem so. She usually goes to an art camp held by our school in the Summer she's a talented artist and that's where her and Claire met, in art class but she felt sick to her stomach before each of the days and ended up skipping 3 out of 4 days that it went on. When our junior year started, she found out that she had an art class and a lunch period with Claire. This was obviously unpleasant news, but we thought that she was handling it well. However, soon enough, the stomachaches started again. As time went on, mostly last week, she got more and more creative with her ways to get out of school. On Tuesday, she walked home from school early without telling anyone because of an anxiety attack, which I thought was understandable, I'd done that before, too. However, on Wednesday, she claimed to have had a terrible nightmare that gave her an anxiety attack that morning, rendering her hyperventilating on the couch, once again, unable to dress herself. Whenever she plays up an illness, she always does 4 things 1 Hyperventilate on purpose 2 Leave her eyes half closed 3 Mumble through words when speaking on purpose 4 Use the word ""man""a lot when she doesn't usually i.e ""What's going on?""I don't know, man, i'm still going to go to school today though, man""The cause of her anxiety is, of course, Claire. However, my sister has allowed this unrequited relationship to fester in all parts of her life, especially socially. She now has deep insecurities about everything, and now suspects that every one of her friends harbors secret resentment against her. Just tonight she told me that she's afraid that out of all of our friends we share a large friend group that's pretty tight knit that Claire was never a part of she is the one the least valued. This is not helped with Claire's continued presence and the fact that Claire has turned one of her friends, a girl named Avery, against my sister. Even though the situation unfolded almost 9 months ago, my sister is not over it in the slightest bit. One of our close friends whom my sister texts about pretty much everything, opened up to me recently about her concerns with my sister. She says that almost every art class, my sister would text her talking about how much she hates Claire, saying things like ""I hope all her friends leave her so she can feel the way I feel""I hope Claire feels guilty about this forever""I bet Claire and friend turned against her still think they're good people, but they're not""and the likes. She has even discussed some dark fantasies, saying my sister has told her of a common intrusive thought she has where she kills Claire and cuddles with her dead body. However, despite all of this, my sister says that there is still a part of her that still desperately wants Anna to be her friend again. Our friend has told me that she feels that my sister is very shrine- in- the- closet obsessed with Claire, and sees no improvement whatsoever in how she feels about her. This is once again bleeding into every segment of her life. Not only is she having academic struggles because of her missing school, but she can't make a new friend without thinking about Claire and being sad because of it. In April, she disappeared for a long time which scared the shit out of me , then I found her crying in the closet because she started having thoughts of ""What if they all leave me like Claire did?""The idea of school gives her anxiety, and this social stuff along with the academic stressors of junior year is making school unattainable. She says that simply going to school is a victory for her. In addition, she's the laziest person i've ever met. All she wants to do all day is lay in bed on her phone. She still goes to therapy, and her psychiatrist has been changing medicines and doubling dosages for a while now. Nothing is working. It's like she doesn't even want to get better. My family is at a loss for what to do. She's getting worse and I really don't know what to do. I feel like she isn't being honest with her therapist, so I fully plan on attending her next therapy appointment and filling her therapist in on what's been going on. I don't know how I can help her. I just want her to feel better. What can we do?","My twin sister had a close friend that she had strong romantic feelings for suddenly give her the cold shoulder and abruptly cut off the friendship . This caused my sister to physically vomit before school and play up illnesses to get out of going to school to face this person . My sister , already on antianxiety medicine and antidepressants and seeing a therapist since middle school . Is very bitter and vindictive , and letting it absolutely ruin her life .

"Awesome music! You guys have a really cool and unique sound that you just dont get often enough in music these days. Im an aspiring musician working on getting better at the bass and Im in the very early stages of forming a band with my musically minded friends. Im currently on day six of 28 of quitting weed to both reset my tolerance and to rebuild a better relationship with it once I return. I started using marijuana medicinally about 7 months ago to help with chronic neck pain Ive had for the majority of my life. My constant use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen was starting to catch up to me and my liver. It also serves a dual purpose of being recreational, I wont lie. Reading through your post, I saw similarities to my experiences. I was smoking almost every evening, then eventually all day on the weekends. The only days I was off of weed were failed attempts at quitting, my previous record was 3 days before Id cave. For a few months I didnt see a problem with it. I was having fun, I felt good and it wasnt impacting my life so I didnt see a reason to quit. When I first started smoking, a pinch of weed would absolutely blast me off to space and last hours. Before I quit, Id be smoking multiple bowls and up to at most 2g an evening after work and up to bedtime. This got costly and I was spending 100 USD a week on weed. Stuff was not as fun, music wasnt as special, food just tasted normal. Every night usually ends in me nodding off on the couch after crashing hard, something that wasnt a problem in the beginning. I let this go on way longer than I should have, but I just couldnt bring myself to quit. The phase in which I should have quit was when weed was still an always fun and happy thing for me. My tolerance was much less back then and it was easier to not smoke for a day if I had to. The first three days of quitting are the most brutal for me. Cravings, my brain feels lost, irritability, insomnia, complete loss of appetite. After three days it starts getting better each day Ive noticed. Cravings are less, my mind feels less distressed, my appetite is returning and my insomnia isnt so bad. I think what is working for me was to first come up with a plan. I set a goal for how long I wanted to quit, I came up with a large list of activities I can do during the week and weekends to keep me distracted from cravings and boredom, then I smoked all of my weed so I had nothing to tempt me. Doing all of this has helped me immensely I think, gave me the proper tools to quit. Quite the essay Ive written, but if theres a","takeaway piece of advice from this , going deeper from here will only make it harder to quit or take a break in the future . Quit while you re ahead , that s what I ve really wished that I had done .",I m on day six of 28 days of quitting and I m feeling a lot better than I did when I started.

"Hello everyone. I apologize if this post is all over the place, I'm kind of freaking out. Let me know if I need to provide anything else or more information. My SO frequents reddit and the bipolar subs, so I hope she doesn't find this and get upset by it. If she does, it is my hope that she recognizes I am talking about us and stops reading this because I know it will be a trigger for her. Anyway.. My wife got diagnosed a few years ago with Bipolar disorder. She had a great job from 2016- may of 2017, but quit very soon after we got married because the stress was too much. The building she was working in was high up and her preferred method for suicide and her suicidal thoughts is to jump from a high place. She left because being there made it more likely she would hurt kill herself. She is on meds, has been since she got diagnosed. Has been hospitalized multiple times for hurting herself making a suicide plan. They typically change her meds or increase a dose here and there and then she comes back home. She does great after coming home from the hospital and hasn't gone into the hospital since September of 2017. Since she quit her job in May of 2017, she has taken on numerous small time jobs, part time server here, nanny there, temp office job, etc. Nothing that stuck. When she did find a great job that would cater to her illness, it was the temp job and they let her go when the project was complete. This tore her up as there was a lot of indication they would keep her on. She found other jobs between then and now but nothing serious. In the meantime, I have been providing for us. Paying our bills, her medical visits, prescriptions, etc. I've had to get a 2nd job recently because we are literally 6 months behind on our bills. We can't afford rent, groceries, utilities, student loan debts, etc. Even with a 2nd job, I can't make enough money to cover both of our living expenses debts. I'm sitting here typing this crying because there doesn't seem to be anything that can be done. She has been denied for disability. She has been told that in order to win an appeal for this denial she would have to be out of work for 3 years.. We cannot afford for her to not be contributing to our bills debt for 3 years. We will not make it. There is no way to get family support from either of our families. I do my best not to let her see how bad things are because I know that is just one more thing on top of what she is dealing with, but we have been just barely skating by for months and are now at the point where we can't pay anything anymore. For the longest time, I just had the thought in my head that I could handle it while she looked for a job and would be able to help again, and I did. She was able to get a few decent jobs, but nothing that she could keep long term. Now she is looking again for employment. But I can't make enough money to do it forever and because of her illness, it doesn't seem likely she can hold down a job. The most recent job she had, she lost because she had to call out her first week because of a bad day. ",I ca n't afford living expenses for my wife and I while she is sick .

" I've posted this as a comment before and I don't feel like typing it again. Long story is I dont think stimulants are going to work for me. Ive got all the classic untreatable conditions chronic fatigue, severe dysmenorrhea, severe IBS, delayed sleep phase disorder, depression, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety. It's so hard to tell between them all and what cause what. Ive had many physical tests to no avail. I'm never worried that I have something more severe but rather annoyed that what I do have is pretty unexplained untreatable. I just don't want to be in physical pain and discomfort anymore. ADHD was recently diagnosed at age 27 and my psychiatrist wants to try all the stimulants first because they are so easy as far as time to take rule out. I'm totally fine with this. Ive already before seeing this doctor failed around 10 anti- depressant anxiety meds including Wellbutrin. I've done cognitive behavioral therapy. After trying the stimulants well go back to untried anti- depressants and then if that fails I guess TMS will be an option. The stimulants seemed to be the holy grail until I had a stomach attack and was crying in the bathroom for hours in pain. Basically about 3- 4 days after I start the medication I have a bad day like that. Vyvanse, adzenys he thought this might work better since its not absorbed in the stomach , and focalin have all had the same reaction. It sucks because they seemed to be helping all my problems and I had a taste of hope. I had more energy but a comfortable amount and I just wanted to get stuff done. It was helping with my sleep and fatigue. I felt happier even if it was mild. But I also get tired of having the episodes occur to me. They are extremely painful and traumatizing and a deal breaker. They've actually made me lose progress with my own personal anxiety and agoraphobia. I've tried taking it with food and avoiding certain foods. Has anyone had this happen via stimulants have similar diagnosis? Have you found anything that has worked for you? I'm just feeling a little hopeless and am looking for some hope and support. amp","Stimulants make me feel normal and great until they do n't and make my stomach explode with rage .

"So to start this off, i've had OCD since I was five, Depression since i was 11, and anxiety for a nice lil garnish along with some hallucinations. It's been pretty shit.

"Last semester, I decided to give Spanish a try. I didn't sign up for it out of interest, but for the fact that I needed to fill in more hours on my schedule and that I needed credits in that area global recognition, elective, or something like that . As we all know, time, effort, exposure to a certain thing can lead to the development of a special interest. Well I now want to minor in Spanish and love learning the cultures and exploring them, especially Mexican. I can assume foreign language and culture is a fairly common special interest among people on the spectrum. For me, I'm doing great with reading, writing, and speaking. We took a placement test Tuesday and the professor told me that due to my score, I could discuss with an advisor about moving to the 3rd level course I am in the 2nd level course right now . I chose t reject the offer as my oral comprehension level is terrible, but then again, it may not be any worse than the rest of the class lol. It's frustrating because of the effort I put in to immerse myself and I have so much trouble understanding a speaker. My oral comprehension in general isn't the greatest with AS and ADD anyway, but hopefully it'll click sometime. The professor speaks with her strong dialect from Argentina and doesn't really bother to slow down or simplify sentences for a class of this level, either.

"So basically my parents were abusive, they kicked me out, and I went to live with my fiance's grandpa. Now after six months he wants to kick me out because basically he's mourning the loss of his wife and hates literally everyone and everything. I've asked him the three times he's tried kicking me out why he was mad at me, and he always just said something stupid like I ate too much pizza or whatever. He now hates his grandson I guess because of me. He got him a used car for his birthday and is now giving it to the other grandson who can't drive just to spite him. He's also tried kissing me and making sexual comments towards me, he gets mad when he can't do my laundry, etc. The thing is I have a pet bird and lizard and I'm willing to sadly leave them behind if need be, but who would take them? I have no idea. My bird was very expensive as well. He was a birthday gift but I paid for him. I've had a history of mental illness and social security is reevaluating me the 16th amp 24th If I get there even. So like I'm screwed?

"Well I mean, the brain is a VERY different muscle from most of the rest here. So it's not a super fair comparison? If I recall correctly, the issue causing executive dysfunction is the failure of the brain to produce the kinds of chemicals that trigger organization skills. So it's not really like a memorization trick or lifting weights, the issue is at a higher level. You can train regular muscles with therapy and repetition because most muscles have a simple function that doesn't require complex strings of chemicals and the foundations of human personality executive dysfunction's just a different beast. But it is also worth noting that like other mental disorders, therapy can help us a bit! I have met people who do claim to have trained themselves out of the dysfunction issue. It just won't make the whole thing go away entirely, and not everyone can benefit from that, because the problem is a chemical reaction failing. Our brains aren't weak like atrophied muscles, they're missing the programming to do what they're supposed to do.

"Hey, so my brother was diagnosed with BPD a couple months ago and I am trying to adjust to interacting with him with that knowledge. I have not gotten far into reading about BPD, although I am making an effort when I have time. Right now he is refusing to speak to me because of an incident that occurred over a month ago. It was his birthday and I asked if I could take him to dinner. On the way, we were talking politics. Both of us are on a similar page in that regard, but he started voicing some extreme and violent opinions, so I tried to gently disagree with him. He got quite heated, but I figured he might calm down over dinner. He went in, used the restroom, emerged and told me I needed to take him home immediately and that he no longer wanted to eat. I said ok, then as we're silently walking to my car, he starts screaming profanities and throws his cell phone on the ground really hard, shattering it. I told him I didn't feel comfortable getting into a car with him at the moment, but that we could leave in a few minutes when he calmed down. He took off, calling me from a department store's phone 20 minutes later and demanding I drive there immediately, pick him up, take him home. I drove there, couldn't find him, asked staff if they had seen someone of his description, they said no. Later I get a call from my mom telling me my brother had walked into a nearby grocery store, grabbed a knife off the shelf, slashed up his arms, and was taken to a hospital via ambulance. He blames me for the incident. After more than a month of silence, I took my brother's counselor up on the offer to give him a call. He says I need to apologize for abandoning him, even though he understands that is not the case. As someone new to BPD, that sounds counter- productive to me, because it seems like it would set a precedent for me needing to habitually apologize for future incidents like this.

"So Im visiting my step brother for Easter and we went out to a couple bars last night, and we ended up getting some late night food after the bars closed. We met these two girls there, and my brother and one girl really hit it off in their own way - they started making out and exchanged numbers, FWB kind of stuff that hes into. But her friend and I really hit it off. She was fiery and bold - she semi- jokingly squirt ketchup all over my stepbros shirt because he was trying so hard to hook up with her friend, and kept threatening to do it again, it was hilarious, but ultimately we all had a lot of fun with each other. She and I spent like three hours talking and I asked her if I could kiss her a couple times, and she got more comfortable engaging me physically non- sexual touching as the night went on. Before we parted ways, she gave me her number and we talked about meeting tomorrow for lunch or something. We kissed each other on the cheek and got into our Ubers . I think she was into me, judging by the conversation and how we would just stare into each others eyes, touch each others hands, and her apprehensiveness to just take it to a sexual level after just meeting me. Also I could imagine she didnt want it to evolve further because Im going home across the country Monday. If I could best describe her demeanor, it was yeah I really like you, and I wish this could grow, but youre about to leave, so why bother. My problem is I cant get her out of my head. Im so unbelievably infatuated with her, and its making me sad that even if we do meet, nothing more will probably happen because of our distance the impossibility of having an LDR as a borderline personality her smile is engrained in my mind and I just miss that feeling I got as we gazed into each others eyes in silence.

"Fun fact, my psychiatrist wouldn't diagnose me unless I got one of these brain scans because I also had symptoms of anxiety and before thinking about treating with medication, she aired on the side of overly cautious, which I understand. ADHD symptoms and anxiety can each be a symptom or the other and therefore the underlying problem difficult to assess . The problem being, the facilities that use these tools for ADHD testing are limited to a handful, and they're incredibly expensive and insurance won't pay for it. My psychiatrist is great for mindefulness and behavioral tools, and we still use those tools towards goals to correct ADHD behavior. Bit I was growing exasperated by my symptoms. Finally, I went to see my primary care doctor and told him the above, and if I could refer me to a conventional ADHD testing site. My wonderful doctor said, being an adult, it would make more sense to try medication to see if it works and go from there. He prescribed me adderall and it's been a night and day difference. My symptoms aren't all just magically gone but I have the tools to tackle things I couldn't usually and my brain isn't as fogged and noisy. Funny, the anxiety symptoms I did have were definitely a symptom of the ADHD because I don't experience them with the adderall. The brain scans need to be used as a commonplace diagnosis for ADHD, I believe. Because I got very lucky in my journey and not everyone will be as lucky as I was.

"I have had 2 bouts with DP DR from a drug the lesser one that is basically legal now , I know I made a mistake the first time, but the second time was in a car while I was asleep. The first time I had DP DR I ended up having one of the worst anxiety attacks and I ended up having a full blood draw fill which actually cured my DP DR on the spot, but that was within 12 hours of realizing how bad of a state I was in. It is scary, and although I cannot really think of anyway to give proof for this, please know that I just want to get this out there because I was afraid for my life.

So sorry for the wall of text. Where to begin? My wife has been in a manic episode for a month or so talked to her doctor nothing worked. Three weeks ago I came home from work and she was gone. She called the next day saying she wanted a divorce and she wasnt happy. I was surprised as we were talking about how happy we were right before her episode. Fast forward a few weeks and she says she wants to try to work it out. I agree and things go goodish for about a week. Then last Thursday she snaps outta nowhere and gets extremely hostile and aggressive. I take her to her moms and call her doctor about an inpatient committal to get her back on meds and out of the mania. A couple hours later I get a call that she has been arrested and charged with a felony. The next day she is released with pretrial probation that she has to report to this last Monday. Saturday night she assaulted her mom and ran off with some trashy meth head guy she met online. They both got arrested yesterday. I visited her today to tell her that I would be seeking the divorce. She was in denial at first talking about how she was in love with this guy and they were gonna marry. I was very hurt and about to walk out when she told me that she was just saying this stuff because I abandoned her that day and that she still loves me. I cant in good faith believe her.

"I stumbled upon this subreddit tonight while in r trees, and many of the posts and comments here have really touched me in a way. Something along the way motivated me to share my relatively brief rendez- vous with Mary Jane with the rest of you. I am currently a college Senior, and for most of my life I almost thought that weed was a myth. It wasn't really until my Sophomore year that I knew of anyone who smoked regularly, and it wasn't until my Junior year that I actually saw it happen. At this point, some very close friends of mine were smoking, and I was pretty good at saying no. Looking back, the real reason I said no was because I was afraid, mainly of the act of smoking itself. Is this weird? I had been debating trying it out for a few days when I finally just threw in the towel. I toked up and was stricken by the experience. I told myself before I started that I wouldn't do it again, but you all know how that goes. I then switched to, ""Well, I won't buy any of my own, ""and then to ""I'll just always go in with someone when buying.""For the next month or so after I started smoking, I was high almost every day, even in classes, meetings, study sessions, etc","I stopped smoking after around a month because of fear of a drug test , and I really noticed how much this daily smoking put me into a ""fog ""even when I was n't really high , or when I had n't smoked for a while .

It was recently suggested to me by a friend diagnosed with ADHD that I get checked out myself. I have previously been treated for anxiety and depression, as well as disordered eating. After their recommendation I tested myself online and scored 100 on an ADHD self- test for adult women. Reading articles about adult ADHD sufferers has been a very emotional experience as they resonate with me so much, which feels partly like a relief. At the same time, contemplating that I might have ADHD is so completely overwhelming that my life has ground to a halt. It feels as if my entire, lifelong self image as someone who is lazy, selfish, thoughtless, weak- willed, and utterly incapable is teetering between shattering to bits and being set in stone forever. It's agonising and confusing and I don't know how to shut it out. It's taking up all of my time to just deal with these thoughts and emotions, when I have an urgent deadline on Thursday! In addition, I had an emotional episode this evening which scared me a lot. My memory of it is hazy, but I felt so completely overwhelmed that I began rocking twitching violently while my partner tried to comfort me in bed. I felt very detached from my personality, though I was conscious. I think I was crying and I was also clenching and unclenching my jaw like crazy. I have had what I thought were panic attacks before, but I've never experienced anything like this and I don't know what it is or whether I should be concerned. I had a first meeting with a counsellor today and spoke about some of my experiences which was quite helpful weirdly I booked it in weeks ago for eating help, so she was surprised when ADHD was all I could talk about. With help from my partner and friend I've also scheduled to see my academic advisor to talk about options and I'm planning to book an ADHD assessment through my university. QUESTIONS Possible tips to keep a handle on my emotions so that they aren't so scary until I can be assessed and get some help? Does anyone know what the episode I experienced might be or how to find information about what it might be? Tips for sleeping would also be AMAZING I'm so tired!

"There is so much going on in my head and hardly anyone to talk to. I broke up with someone on Monday because it had become painfully obvious that we weren't moving in the same direction. It was long distance, and we both work quite a lot so it took nearly a month to even have a day to discuss things. By then we both knew what was going to happen, but I held out for doing it in person. We had dated for two years, broke up for a year, and started again in June 2012. Around January he said he wanted to marry me. I was so surprised and happy. Then by April he started pulling away, we were arguing over whether we should have an open marriage or not. He has bipolar II, and is prone to manic ideas that don't pan out, but he had talked to his mother about it despite his rocky relationship with his parents! so I thought it was the real deal. Our relationship had been open, with full disclosure. But, I came to find out that there was a lot of people and things he chose not to tell me about. I was so hurt and lashed out, I did and said things that I feel guilty for. I wish it was black- and- white, it would be easier to put it behind me. Anger and guilt are sawing back and forth across my mind and it's so fucking hard to function. I was also diagonsed with depression late last year. I went on Wellbutrin, and I've been seeing a therapist since May. Things had improved so I stopped taking it, because deep down I don't WANT to be on anything at all. Big mistake, I know. I started it again last week. The upside is that the therapist has been the best one I've had yet. Unfortunately, I slept in and missed my appointment on Tuesday because I was so exhausted from the breakup the day before. And then today, I withdrew from the one class I was taking because I realized that I wasn't going to be able to keep up. It's a Certified Nurse Aide CNA class, I took it over the summer but didn't pass. I thought I'd try again but with everything going on, it's hard to find the motivation. My post- secondary experience in general is riddled with failure. I graduated from high school in 07 and have been floundering around different colleges since then","Constant fog of depression , combined with breakup causes me to pull out of school .

"I was doing pretty well for most of the spring, after a very long and hard period of extreme depression. I had been treated as an outpatient for mental health by the VA for a while, with mixed results. Started seeing a private doc with very good results. Couldn't afford it, and went back to the VA. Changed meds again, started to backslide. Anyhow, in the span of a few days, I started to pretty much lose it. I got pissed at my job, my friends, my roommates. I moved out and quit my job. I drove several states away and found a flophouse on craigslist. I thought I could get it together, find work, and start over. Nope. Things got worse. I started mixing old medicines with new ones and started having scary problems with my body. I aggravated a neck injury too, I think. Unless that is the drugs too. Or maybe I'm just crazy. Anyways, now I just sit in this room, sleep, and go on the computer. I can't motivate myself to do anything, even though I desperately need work. I also feel like I need to go to a hospital and detox, rest, and have them try and figure out whats wrong with me. At least make sure I'm just crazy, and not dying. Except, if I get hospitalized, I'm not working. I won't be able to pay my rent in 2 weeks. They'll probably just throw my few belongings in the trash or steal them its that kind of place . Also, I've had some bad experiences with the VA, and I've read horror stories about being an inpatient in some of them. I don't have insurance though, so I don't think I can go to a ritzy private mental hospital. So I dunno. I've spent the last 3 days staring at the walls pretty much, losing my mind. We are constantly bombarded by charities and shit saying 'donate to support veterans soldiers'. Will one of these places give me money so I can pay my rent while I am in the hospital?

"So I recently started cutting again after not for around a year or so. I had a suicidal episode and many more panic attacks in the month of December. I went to my normal psychologist and told her what happened as well as being informed that I'm in an abusive relationship. I showed her the scars and she told me she wanted to send me to a partial hospitalization. Basically you go from 9- 3 everyday and get intensive therapy but go home to sleep, eat, bathe etc. I was able to talk her into giving me one week to see if a boost in medication to see if I still had these thoughts and if I wanted to stay in my relationship. She also set me up with a therapist who specializes in my condition bpd PTSD I cut tonight, quite literally 30 minutes ago and I'm starting to think that it's getting bad.

"For over a decade now Ive been dealing with some serious anxiety that seems to only progress and is beginning to hurt me physically. Symptoms include headaches, acid reflux so bad I can smell it, sweating and an inability to focus or correctly perform tasks that Ive done a million times before. Well, the last three or four days have been so strange. These symptoms have all but disappeared and even when my mind WANTS to have anxiety without reason, my body just doesnt respond to it and those symptoms do not manifest in the ways they used to. Ive been so calm and so peaceful, and Im realizing the life Ive been missing for most of my 20s. Lately Ive been trying to speak positively and essentially rebuke anxiety and tell it that it does NOT have a place in my life any longer. Im not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. The reason Im afraid is because if the symptoms start showing up again, Im worried that the feeling of despair will be too much to handle. Im afraid that this is only short lived and Ill find a way to slip back into that mental illness again. After all, my brain has wired itself to be anxious about everything for a decade now and Ive only been free of it for less than week.

I have a 4.0 GPA and I will do anything to maintain it, including studying working on projects for 12 hours a day with no breaks. My OCD has gotten worse. I am very obsessive, compulsive, and impulsive. Sometimes I find myself at a club meeting after school and barely recall making the decision to go there. I eat impulsively now. I ate A LOT today, almost like a binge. It makes me feel very anxious because I don't want to gain weight. I've lost myself. I don't know where I am or what I'm doing. Schoolwork is so difficult to do now. I cry constantly, I can't do the things I used to and it upsets me. I want myself back. I feel like I need time off of school. I need deadlines pushed back. I need the teachers to understand that I am not okay right now. If I had the choice I would be in a mental hospital because this is getting too much to handle.

"This is kind of my final hope for someone to listen, so get ready for a life story. I am a 19 year old male, and i've been battling depression for almost 10 years. I was the ""freak""of my Elementary school because i was always so goofy and hyper, i would get excited over little things and jump off the walls and i was always such a ""crazy child"". This caused the school to send a letter of preference to my parents to put me on medication for ADHD, and starting then is when it hit, the medication didnt work. It turned me into a drooling zombie who wouldn't move or have the energy to talk, and id get dragged literally dragged because i had no energy to move to the principal's office for ignoring the teacher. i was labeled a problem child and it haunts my mind to this day. starting in 5th grade i was constantly bullied for being hyper, and then bullied for not talking, i was off the medication yet my ""personality""never recovered, i changed into an angsty emo hot topic boy who just couldn't talk to people. I was becoming afraid of my own classmates, i'd fake sick and do everything i could to NOT go see them. When i was 12 i was beaten senseless by 2 9th graders with a brick and a bat, i had broken 3 ribs and my clavicle, and had head trauma. i was in the hospital for 4 weeks, blaming myself, telling myself that they had every reason to do it because look at me. Middle school never got better, i did not have a single friend because i was so afraid to talk to anyone, and nobody wanted to talk to me, however, it's in the human nature to try to communicate, and that's what i tried to do. However i did that by trying to attract bad attention, but atleast it was some kind of attention. I would jump on people, i would bite people, i would do anything to cause a reaction, to force someone to talk to me, because whenever i acquired enough courage to tell someone ""Hi""i'd get the usual ""Get away, freak"". I was sent to an Avera hospital for a suicide attempt, it's a mental treatment facility for depressed teens and adults, i was there for a week and was released with a new diagnosis, as it turns out, the reasons the medications didn't work was because i was Autistic, under the Aspergers spectrum. Because of my actions i was kicked out of the ""normal""high school and transferred to a Level 4 school, my class size for the next 2 years was 4 people, myself included, and these were kids who stabbed people, sold drugs, and broke other laws. I was not a bad kid, I am not a bad kid. I wanted attention, the school was closed down due to mold and i was then transferred to a school 30 miles away from home to another Level 4 school. after 2 years there aswell, i finally started trying to talk to people because the loneliness was to much, and i started making ""friends""People who would use me for money, however they would spend time for me and thing finally started to turn around, i was 15 and in 9th grade, and i wanted to see the people i grew up with again, i wanted to go back to ""normal""school. and after a year of transferring i was back, and i was actually happy again, now realize at 11, i was a 4'5""scrawny harry potter look- alike with KoRn and Metallica shirts and when i returned i was a 6 foot tall, burly kid with long hair in my face and the same shirt, i was intimidating? i guess, so people didn't want to talk to me, but i tried, and i tried. SOMEHOW, i got a girlfriend, we were both the same, lonely, hot topic kids, with parental problems, Her mom was a crack whore and my dad was an abusive alcoholic, and things were good for about 3 month, she was my first sexual experience ever, me at 16, her at 15, and because of which her mother put a restraining order on me and my family and succeeded. and i was alone again. we weren't allowed to talk. and i attempted suicide for the second time. no one cared. It was terrible. 11th grade hit and i made my first best friend, his name was Mitchell, and i was over at his house every single day, spent the night everyday, played Pokemon every single day, Left 4 dead, everything, it was awesome and i was happy. I became more outgoing and friendly, i was always the kid to take care of injured animals and help out people in need, but now i had communication skills to be a productive member of society and i dabbled through girlfriends and friends, but just wasnt happy, skip through the year and i SOMEHOW WAS ACCEPTED INTO NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY! my lord i was happy, i was ""normal""and i moved 5 hours away to NDSU, and it was great for awhile, but let me sum up my college experience in events so this doesnt become too long.

"Hi Reddit, 22 male, Clinical Depression, ADHD I, Anxiety Dexamphetamine for ADHD I, no medication for other two. I'm going to try and keep this short. A year ago after working at a company as a Casual Data Entry Clerk an opportunity presented itself, after the Payroll Manager quit, to take over her role despite having no experience, which I did. The role offered minimum wage which was less than half what they were paying the previous payroll, but I wanted stability as I had a bit of a spotty employment history so I took the role. Unfortunately after the first few months I quickly learned I disliked the role immensely and the money isn't worth the stress but I have still stuck it out for a year. I feel like this job sucks all the enjoyment out of everything I am and know and I am now ready to hand in my letter of resignation. I worry that if I quit I will run into the same issues at another company.

"I went to my doctor yesterday and told him about how I can't sleep, my apatite swings, and my complete and total apathy. He said I was clinically depressed, and that I should start anti- depressants asap. It was nice hearing someone put a label on this stupid feeling, or rather lack- there- off I've had for the better part of a year. I'm not even sad anymore, just fucking numb. I hope these pills help, because I honestly don't know how much longer I can cope with this. I hate it because I feel so helpless. I hate how much my mom hurts for me, she was in tears the other day because she didn't know how to help me. I'm tearing up thinking about it know. But the worst part is my friends. They either really don't notice, or i've been depressed way longer than I thought. Maybe i'm just a good actor. I've tried therapy, and it didn't go anywhere. I hated it, I really did. Maybe I should give it another shot. The only thing that used to get me up in the morning was a girl I met. But she just wanted to be friends, and decided to fuck a few of mine. I don't blame her though, she's got more issues than I do. Playing guitar and drawing are the two things I have to deal with depression. I write out lyrics to songs I haven't played and I draw until my hand hurts. I turn my amp up so loud it pisses my neighbors off. I woke up this morning and it was raining. I live in Texas, it hasn't really 'rained' in two years. The smell was almost foreign to me. I sat on my porch for two hours and just watched the rain fall. Eventually the sun came out and for the first time in a long, long time I genuinely smiled. Today reaffirmed my faith, that one day this will get better. I've never told anyone this butsuicide has crossed my mind more than once. The worst was a few weeks ago, I found a 12 gauge shell in my truck while I was cleaning it. I went inside and stared at the gun safe in our garage and contemplated ending it. Thankfully I never went through with it. That shell is sitting on my desk as a reminder, I wrote 'cowards way out' on the green plastic with a sharpie. I hate my life, and I hate getting up everyday, but I will not cop out like that. I wrote this out to possibly disuade anyone feeling as lost as I did from ending it. Funerals are for the living, and depression is a bitch, but things will get better.

"Not sure if this is the right place for this but I have no idea how to deal with this and could use some insight. My girlfriend has had a drinking problem for most of her adult life. She has a rheumatic disease along with anxiety and I think that she turned to drinking and drugs to self medicate her pain. Before we started dating, she had been in various rehab clinics for various issues. After having her second hip replacement surgery last year she was able to slow her drinking down to between 2- 5 strong IPAs after work. This was a big improvement. Prior to this, she would drink to a point where her personality would change drastically and she would become dangerous and mean and put herself in unsafe situations. These were some of the worst nights of my life but nothing I did or said seemed to have any lasting effect. Lately, this has started happening again. After a particularly bad night a week ago she decided to try and take a break from drinking. On Monday she was acting strange, not drunk, but I knew something was very off. I found a bunch of Xanax in her purse and when I confronted her she said that the only other time she had quit drinking before they had prescribed them for her. I was not OK with this but our arguments just go in circles. Then Thursday I came home and she was drunk and on the pills it was rough but we got through it. Today we had another episode at a baby shower where she wanted to drink, and did, despite being on the pills, and I had to cut her off and bring her home because I could see her personality starting to change. When we got home she went on a rant about wanting to be put in rehab and then an equally long rant about how she didn't want to end up in rehab. I know she needs help and it is more than I can provide. I just don't know if she actually thinks she needs help or will even listen to a doctor or professional. Since last week it is rare that she is not on Xanax, so I can't even talk to her when she is clear headed. I try to be hopeful that we can fix this but right now it feels so hopeless. Also, because of her disease, it is critical that she doesn't lose her job health insurance, so I am wondering what the best course of action is","girlfriend has a drinking problem that is getting progressively worse and a disease that requires healthcare and I 'm not sure if I should seek out rehab , a psychiatrist , inpatient , outpatient or what .","My girlfriend has a drinking problem and I don't know how to deal with it.

"Okay, I haven't posted on here before I'm not even really sure if this is the place to post and I can get a bit rambly but I will try to keep this structured clearly but here goes. amp So a bit of history, I have been sexually abused a fair bit. Molested when I was a child, then groomed online later probably stemmed from the first incident and then my ex boyfriend also abused me sexually at times. I have also been physically and emotionally abused at home, but thankfully the physical aspect stopped. So needless to say, I have a big trauma centre in my head. I'm very open about my past to most people just not my parents and especially my boyfriend as he went through a similar sexual abuse experience in his past. Up until yesterday I honestly believed that I had passed through the self- ashamed and self- hatred stage. I was functioning well and rarely even thought about everything. Anyway Yesterday I was with my boyfriend and without going into much detail we were getting into things. Everything was definitely consentual and I wholeheartedly trust my boyfriend, but we were trying something different and I was enjoying it but felt a little anxious. But as soon as we had finished I was so upset. I had nothing in particular in my brain as to why but I felt like I was going to burst out crying and I felt that same ashamed used feeling I have felt many years before. It is not my boyfriends fault, and he is being really supportive in trying to help me but I just don't understand these feelings and what to do with them.

"I've suspected for some time that I might have ADHD. I saw some stuff online recently that hit me really hard in the sense that it was very relatable.

I talked to one in particular yesterday that sounded really good, but towards the end of the call they mentioned that they don't take insurance. Ugh I could probably deal with that from a financial perspective but I know how good I am at procrastinating the important things and submitting receipts to insurance is not something I want to add to my to- do list. While I was on the phone with them, the person doing the intake started asking me about my symptoms. I feel like there's a lot of them. I just kinda started rambling things off.

"I am struggling with this exact thing right now. I have a very strong desire to be a ""good Christian"", according to the true religion of love, not the religion of good works. Because I desire so deeply to follow God and trust Him in everything, I sometimes get OCD and faith confused, and it sounds a lot like what you are describing. I'm having a really bad compulsion day today. I've been in the bathtub for 2.5 hrs and I will probably be in here til my husband comes home or the house catches on fire. Though I would probably stay in the bathtub for the second one. Haha. It's because I've gotten into a compulsion loop mentally with some intrusive thoughts and false beliefs about myself. For example, I read a Bible verse this morning that says, ""The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them he delivers them from all their troubles."". The intrusive thought was, ""I have troubles, and have not been delivered. That must mean I am not righteous and God doesn't hear me."". I'm sure you can see how this would destroy someone with OCD. But now, looking back, I can see that I am falling into two patterns with my obsessionsthe need for certainty, and an overactive sense of responsibility. The true Christian message is that God produces righteousness within us, not that we ourselves can produce righteousness from our own striving. I can't believe that and simultaneously believe that I am not righteous. I am taking the responsibility of God to produce righteousness within me and applying it to myself. I'm sure that sounds like a lot of wishy washy weirdness if you don't believe in God, so I will apply the same thing to your situation. You said that you have shamed yourself for your emotions. Example you were angry at your mom and then felt guilty. You then start asking questions in a mental obsessive loop about what a good person should or shouldn't do. Here's the truth about life..there's no black and white good and bad. Two people can go out and have a beer. For the casual drinker, that's fine. For the alcoholic, it isn't. So therefore you cannot make blanket statements like, ""being angry is bad"". It's also proven that you cannot choose your emotions, but you can choose what to do with them. So striving to never be angry is impossible. You have unrealistic expectations of yourself if you expect to never be angry. Hopefully some of that makes sense? I guess my","would be yes , I seriously struggle with this . I call it ""shoulding ""all over myself . Hehe .

"So, this is more of a rant than anything, butDAE here have this issue as well? My story I have been working for 8 years now - I took long to find out what I wanted to study in the first place - and have been working for 4 different companies now. I am currently working on a limited contract at an automotive supplier that will not be extended or made indefinite due to a restructuring within that company, and my employment will be over in August. The one before also automotive supplier , I left because I got married to my then LDR guy, but I worked there for 3, 5 years. Before that, I was employed at a temp agency as a last resort customer service , because before that, I was employed first job at a company varnishes and glues for food- industy related products that realized they needed someone else with different qualifications think sales and acquisition vs. website maintenance and office work . I am beyond stressed out that despite my hard work in all of those companies, I am once more out of a job. I am also aware that the industry I have been working in for the last five years is usually rather stressful, which normally means that whatever job I have leaves me tired, strung- out and mopey when I come home. Before anyone asks, yes, I am on medication and their level is right for me - I got to test that out during the last 12 years. Taking a year off is also not in the cards for me due to limited funds . Now, I am wondering if it is maybe not that I am bad at my job as such but rather that I made the wrong decision with my degree. All of that would not be too bad, because you can always switch industries, right? I feel, however, that with my experience in various industries in the last years, it might not be them , it might be me . It doesn't help that I am so tired usually that I don't really have any hobbies that might be turned into a job. I mostly like to read and sing in a choir. I am also aware that there are several tools, mostly online, that help you figure out which job might be the best for you - however, whenever I do one of those, the results tend to vary wildly due to my having eaten lunch, time of test- taking, general level of anxiety, and last night's dreams. As such, my job suggestions vary between manager - gardener - nurse - shepard - writer - secretary - fill- in- your- own- suggestion type of work. So, I guess my question is how have you found your niche? Do you have any new suggestions for me how I might find out what kind of job suits me? I really want to find something that will work for me and my husband in the long run, I am tired of starting over again and again without any financial security","Have degree , am willing to work , have been working in various industries during the last 8 years .

"EDIT- AN existential rant. Forgive me, its 430 on Christmas. I'm not sure what my goal is with this, but I was thinking about writing some of my thoughts down today and I figured this would work. I legitimately contemplated my own sanity today. I am an atheist but to humor my mother, as I do every Christmas Eve, I went to church with her. I sat in church today and just stood in awe at the collective mentality of the people who were there. They were all so happy. They seemed absolutely satisfied with their faith and their family, two concepts I have always struggled with. I felt alienated from literally everyone in the room. I have never been a very family oriented person and following my parents divorce at a young age, I have been relatively independent and self sufficient. Today, the only way I felt like I could ever be as happy, or at least as content as the people around me is to do something drastically different. Happiness, conceptually, is impossible for me to grasp without breaking almost all societal norms and being either a ""hippie""or just fucking weird. I hate the idea of family and being tied to one location. I hate the idea of a job, where the monotony makes me trudge through the days. Honestly my dream is to be able to pay all of my debts, satisfy my family as best as I can monetarily, and just leave. But I am torn by this overwhelming guilt if I were to leave. The fact that this consumes me almost constantly scares me sometimes because I feel like I am just teetering on the edge of abandoning everything. If if I sever all ties is everything else futile?

"I would describe my 6 year old son as 90 ADHD and about 10 ASD. I really think both come from similar brain wiring, but as far as behaviors are concerned, he has everything on the ADHD list and a few from ASD. He has been evaluted 3 times and every time they have said he only has ADHD. The first time was when he was 3 because his preschool kept pushing me to. They said the signs pointed to ADHD, but that he was too young for a diagnosis. The second time was a year and a half later to see if the results were any different because we were trying to decide if we should put him in kindergarten or not and the results were almost exactly the same, but this time he was older and they were more confident about the ADHD diagnosis. We ultimately decided not to put him in school because we didn't feel like there was a place for him there. He was too intellectually ahead for his grade level, but emotionally socially behind for his own age level let alone a grade level he should have been at for his learning ability. The third evaluation was a month ago and the reason we decided to do that one was because of some more ASD behaviors he was exhibiting. I didn't feel like ADHD was the total picture. The mental health therapist still said ADHD, but when I spoke with the psychiatrist she saw why I thought he had some ASD and agreed with me. She offered formal testing if I wanted a diagnosis, but I didn't really see a reason for it. All I really want is to understand him better and get him help relating to others. He wants to be social and make friends, but has a difficult time reading others and knowing how to have a good back and forth conversation. There is a social skills class group I'm going to have him take in the summer the one going on currently is in the middle of it and I can't join right now and he doesn't need a diagnosis for that. So I'm wondering, is there any real benefit to having a diagnosis? I know if we do decide to put him in school that we'll need it in order to get him an IEP, but is that the only real reason? Is there anything I don't know about that makes it beneficial?","My son has very very mild aspergers or ASD as they 're calling it now , but has not been diagnosed with it because he has n't received the proper testing for it .

"Hi, I am currently in the process of submitting supplementary forms into my application for university.

"I'll be clear I love my mother. She's one of the most important people in my entire life, yet I can't forget what she did and it hurts me everyday. I have never shared this story with anyone, not even with the closest people to me. I'm not really going into details. My father died when I was about 7 years old. I don't really remember that, I don't know if I want to remember. Anyway, since that time my mom got extremely abusive towards me. I can't count how many times I got told that ""it's all my fault"", that if ""I wasn't there dad would still be with her""or that she ""wished I didn't exist"". Whatever I tried doing, it was always bad or wrong to her, ""she could have done that better"". I tried my very best to make her happy, to make her proud, to feel like a worthy child - but I was still a human, a young one too, I did mistakes. If I did anything wrong and she saw that, I would always end up getting beaten. I had bruises, scratches, few times she even threatened me with a knife. I wish I was lying about that. She led me to heavy depression, from which I suffer even today, social anxiety and being overall suicidal. I didn't seek help, I was afraid of her getting into trouble because of that. I still loved her, no matter what she was like. I tried killing myself few times before, didn't really work. When it was time for me to go to middle school, I broke down mentally. I lost contact with my best friends, went to a new class with new people. It was too much for me to handle. If I coudln't see my friends anymore, there was no reason for me to go to school. I have locked myself in my house, my room, for days, for weeks. Of course, this didn't go without her noticing it. But this time, she wasn't angry. She acted like a typical, innocent mother, the one that I longed for. She seeked help for me, psychiatrists, psychotherapeutists etc","any mental help I could have gotten . It did n't help me much , considering I still have trouble with mental health . Even if she acts like a normal , caring mother now , I ca n't forget what she was , and what hell she did make out of my life .

We both are, everything has been sorted out, have a flat, got deposit, my jobs being transferred, I'm changing my daughters school. Everything is set and ready to go. However, I am TERRIFIED. Everytime I think about moving and everything I have to do I get this overwhelming sense of fear, I have suffered with anxiety since my daughters birth 5 years ago. I have a phobia of being sick, or being around anyone who is sick, now this isn't related at all to moving, but when I think about the move I feel sick to my stomach which of course sets off my anxiety. I'm not having second thoughts or cold feet about moving, I have nothing here, no family no friends, just me and my daughter. So it makes perfect sense to be with somebody we both love. It's not even that far, it's about 40 minutes by car which is nothing I guess!

"Context I started dating this girl more than a month ago, but we've been friends for two years. Her family was made up of her mother unemployed , father only source of income , she eldest and her three brothers and sisters one of them having Down Syndrome Ever since I met her she has had problems with her dad actually step- dad , be it him taking away her phone to see who she's talking to, physical abuse to every member of his family, neglectment especially to his daughter with Down Syndrome and an overall controlling and manipulative attitude. Although all the things he has done to her, she had always had a close relationship with him they're both gamers, etc. When I started dating her, her father was the biggest problem between us, as she wasn't allowed to date she couldn't even text boys . However, after like two weeks he found out and grounded her forever not allowed to date, without phone and even thought about making her change schools . Nonetheless, her mother who had never intervened or had any authority in the house intervened, breaking up with her husband and lifting her daughter's punishment. That was all two weeks ago. During the following days, her dad begged my girlfriend to console her mom, whilst, on the other side, her mother didn't allow any contact with him. Due to this, my girlfriend felt very pressured and thought the breakup and subsequent divorce was all her fault - here I tried to console her, telling her that se wasn't respondible for this situation and that things ""can only go up from here"". Today I found out that when her mother banished her husband from her home, he refused, hitting her, and all the children. Due to this, she called the police, and they were all transported to the nearest police station. However, she just told me her father commited suicide She will be likely changing schools they have no source of income now , may lose their home and don't know what to do with their lives.

"I want to start off by saying, my life hasnt been hard by any means. I grew up in a middle class family that, to all exterior views, looked like a close family. Under the exterior has always been an ugly monster of a facade. Brief history of me craniosynastosis at 5mo operated on by your favorite secretary of housing and urban development I died on the operating table which led to brain stem damage. Didnt know this until I was 23. It explained a lot. Flash forward, early childhood obesity. Not due to lack of metabolism. Looking back, I was always healthy in that sense more on this later . This was due to an unhealthy relationship with food. Mental and verbal abuse by my family and poor early childhood food decisions from my parents would eventually make me 400lbs one day. There was some physical abuse back in the day, but none I can explicitly remember the full details of. Nothing sexual. Grew up awkward in school. Loved to sing, but never got recognition for it. Was always made fun of for being too loud and interjecting by friends..So I got softer. So much softer I caused a permanent rasp and prepubescent crack in my voice at a young age. This, I found out later in life, causes a lot of my problems now as a professional singer. Middle school was tough. Best and only friend moved to NY for the time we were never close again . Multiple trips to fat camp and weight loss programs, an awkward AC DC trench coat and barrette phase, and a bar mitzvah where more kids attended out of being forced to than actually being my friend. I wasnt even really in my grand bat mitzvah photo..I was basically smothered out and covered up by assholes. High school came, lost a bunch of weight to play football. Had some decent friends for awhile and did lead roles in the school musicals. Captain of JV football. Then I got injured and gained 300lbs. Friends stopped taking me seriously and stopped talking to me. By senior year, the senior week group I put together of my closest friends voted me out. Humiliatingly, when they couldnt get the hotel shit together like a bunch of idiots, they invited me back to organize shit. Sadly, I did. Was accepted to college and sadly decided to leave music behind convinced there was no money to be made and facing the pressure of a Jewish family with ridiculous standards. It was around this time I started dating an insane woman. It was bad from the start. College comes around, made some new close friends of my roommates. Gf cheated on me multiple of times. Ruined my freshman year. My grades tanked and my friends left me because I kept going back. She was all I had. Sophomore junior year, decide to audition for my universitys music program as a singer. Pass and am immediately accepted into the recording tech program. Always had an interest. Spent the next 4 years fucking around, gaining more weight, becoming a pot head, and ultimately, hating myself. I was passing all the recording and singing classes but not the music ones. Around what would be my senior year had I not switched majors I got an internship at Polk Audio. I was fired when my boss threw me under the bus to save himself and was too lazy to set up my banking and direct deposit with me. He accused me of stealing when extra money got deposited to me without me knowing. Offered to give it back, didnt matter trust had been broken. I was a fucking intern. Flash forward a few years. Mom diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer on my brothers birthday. Survives but is mentally never the same she wasnt ok to begin with . Now will never stop talking about breast cancer. Ruining her marriage by never wanting to move on or be happy once in remission. And that takes us up to now. Two years ago I hated myself so much I got gastric sleeve surgery and went from 400lbs to 170lbs. Actually just had and am recovering from the plastic surgery. Hated myself for making this decision, hate not being able to eat, hate my scars, hate myself as a person and idea even more for what I represent. Started dating my current gf around a year post gastric sleeve. I love her, but she always discounts my feelings and treats me like a selfish, immature, sorry for this bitch. Read my previous posts in Relationships to get an idea. Right now shes in another state partying and drinking without me. I feel wonderful. Recently had a brief internship at a tv and film production house as the CEOs assistant, but then got told my job was being replaced and put on hold for another producer ready to go in California where my boss is from. He apparently has more experience though the point was to teach me was it not? Now on hiatus with that. That and my recent gf drama are the least devastating of my conflicts this recent month. Only thing looking up for me at 25 is that Im about to start interning at Sirius XM possibly and am really looking forward to it..but I dont want to get too excited just to get replaced again or let down by crippling disappointment..again","nothing redeeming about my life . Hate myself in the sense of who I am , how I look and what I represent . Pretty sure my family hates me too . Failure on all levels . I had what most would refer to as a silver spoon and all I had to do was deal with some abuse to use it .. I m sure I m not close to the worsts case of events on here , but I m pretty close to losing all hope at this point and not seeing much upside to sticking around . People would cry for maybe a week .. a few months tops . And then they d remember I m no longer a financial and emotional drain . And everything can get better .. right ?","My life has been shit.

"The last time I used a popular dating app was two years ago and ever since then I logged out and deleted the app and never went back on again. Someone found out today that I will be joining their group of friends to go watch Avengers Endgame last minute and I don't even know if it's worth seeing on opening day or before opening day anymore when I have such huge social anxiety. Of course people want to play ""catch up""and ask me a bunch of questions already through messaging. I was hoping I could just show up to the movie late at night and just go home without having to socialize much. Maybe a hi and bye tbh. I think this played a huge part in my decision I hate making decisions to choose the latest showtime choice out of all the choices so that people don't ask if I want to grab something to eat after or do something else instead of going straight home.. The movie basically starts at 11 PM so no one's going to get home until about 3 AM Well, the point I was trying to get to is that the person who messaged me would make me feel bad about not responding in group chats or just not showing up to the group events often throughout the year.. I'm not really close with anyone but I just can't get myself to bond with people especially in groups like that anymore.. ? Especially when everyone else already knew each other for a longer time or close with one another from before. I just feel like I can never fit in anyway. So I'm just saying how I don't really go out much these days to explain why I never confirmed to go watch the movie with them on opening day but they just ask ""are you going on dates lately on so- and- so app?"".. and that just increased my anxiety by tenfold because I know I used to go on that. They told me they saw me ""last online today""and that just made everything worse because I started thinking someone hacked my account or it was a fake profile using my photos.. And also made me think that they probably thought I was lying about not going out much lately. It's just so f cking awkward and weird to have acquaintances come across your dating profile regardless.

"I am not happy and I think I know why. I am depressed, have an anxiety disorder, and feel helpless. I am so alone these days that I've just taken it as normal to spend the entire day and night on my computer, sitting in my bed and skimming the internet for surface knowledge that makes me feel better about myself because it deluded me into thinking I'm accomplishing something by listening to podcasts or doing math problems on khan academy and gaining knowledge. However, it's all a big avoidance mechanism that I use to get away from thinking bad things about myself. Mainly I am blank minded these days. I have, for a while now been unable to think about myself in a good light in any scenario. I feel stupid. I think my mind is rotten. I think about killing myself and other people, but know I never will. I can't look at people as I pass them by. Whenever I visit colleges I feel alone. People around me talk to me and party or laugh and I stare at things as if I'm interested but I feel blank. I can't muster and energy to think to respond to socialize. I see people who are passionate and excited when they talk to one another but I have this cold gaze that makes me start to think other people dislike me. They are disinterested in me after a moment and I can see it in their eyes No one thinks of me highly. They all think I'm stupid and brush me off. When I try to talk to them voices in my head filter what I'm saying and make it utterly impossible to get out anything literate. I just fake it. I fake everything. It's beginning to make me feel like I can't do anything. I have no work ethic, I'm lazy and have a computer addiction. My criticality keeps me from trying anything. And so, I just rot my mind away with no sleep and no food. My dad doesn't understand and my mom won't talk to me. I feel unable to find a direction. I thought maybe I wanted to do math and science, but I feel far too stupid compared to people I met. I recently visited a college and three students who I tagged along with because no one was interested in me, probably because I'm ethnic and their all white, well the three students were absolute geniuses. They referenced everything from Star Trek to something called XKCD and I felt like a complete sack of worthless stupidity as I stood their not contributing anything to the conversation. My past used to be my only excuse for not being well read as I went through a huge divorce and didn't have the opportunities to be academic. Instead I fought my moms manipulation and my dad's anger problems, and the intense feeling of insecurity and not fitting in at school for being smart and labeled as gifted made me retreat into a mirroring state where I copied the popular kids who took me under their wing, most likely because I looked ethnic and not like a nerd. I had to act tough and pretend I wasn't Jewish, hiding my identity to fit in. Eventually I couldn't take the people who were dumb I mean they valued different things and were cliche, copying everyone to look cool, unoriginal, etc, cheating on tests, calling me dumb and I left then but I've been friendless since. Alone everyday in my garage. I constantly worry that I one day will kill myself because if I think these thoughts now and I can barely suppress them, won't they grow in the next 80 years I have on this planet? And the only reason they are suppress able is because I am disgustingly dependent on my dad for everything.

"Backstory I started college in 2016. School has always been a bit of a struggle for me, but I did pretty well for the first year. I got diagnosed in 2018, but I wasnt really in treatment. Around the same time, I transferred schools, to a more rigorous amp respected program. In hindsight this was probably a bad move. I was hospitalized twice, once in October 2019 and once in February 2020, at which point I made the decision to withdraw. I had become horribly behind in my program and the administration was less than helpful, at times bordering on discriminatory. At first the emotional tension was high, and I mostly just wanted to be out of the mess. The actuality of the situation didnt set in for several months, but now Im real real sad. I actually love school, when Im not succumbed to depressive apathy or losing it in manic paranoia. I have something like 70 completed credit hours, and I had a really solid gpa. If a school would work with me instead of punishing me for ending up in the hospital, Id actually be done pretty quickly I think. Its a huge bummer. Ive been thinking about trying to go back, but Im overwhelmed. Money is an issue now. I would probably have to work full time during the program, but I need to be careful to not over exert or Ill just put myself right back in the hospital. There seems to be very little information for nontraditional students, in terms of aid. Plus Im honestly a little bit afraid of going back after the treatment I got from admins at the last school","I dropped out of school and I m sad about it I would like to hear from others whose school journey was complicated , and how y all did it .

"I 20F started dating this girl 21F around 2 months ago, and at first it was going really well, but after the honeymoon phase went away, I was left with the doubts of whether I was dating her because I actually like her, or because I like the idea of a relationship. Throughout the relationship I was extremely anxious with almost every aspect of it, and since coming back from the holidays my depression has gotten worse again. I've been dealing with it for around 5 years now and I take medication and everything, but I haven't had a relationship where I was actually really interested in the person before she's the first girl i've dated, I found out that I'm gay when I was around 17 or 18 . I played it up to be a lot more in my head than it was, and I was left with a lot of anxiety and apathy. last week I came to the conclusion that I really do just like her as a friend, and I ended things. Now Im seriously doubting my decision, and I cant tell whether this is because I genuinely made the wrong choice and would like to try again, or if its just dumpers regret. Our communication in the relationship was also extremely terrible, and she came over today to talk, and that talk was the most open weve been with each other the whole time we were dating. But I also am extremely low on energy and have been really down i'm guessing partly because of the season . I guess Im just having problems with being self- aware. Im a very oblivious person when it comes to my own feelings, so when thinking about whether I like her as a friend or romantically, I am completely lost and flip flop between the two, and if this is actually the problem, or if it is all due to my depression and, I guess laziness at the thought of confronting my anxiety in this relationship and trying to fix it. I dont want to string her along through all of this, so I was only going to ask her to try again if I was completely sure how I feel, but the problem is that throughout most of the relationship, I wasnt sure about a lot of things. Has anyone else gone through this? Or have any advice on what I should do?

"Welcome to my rant. Tried to pack my whole life story into it but even I got bored. All you really need to know is I'm 20, had little to no parenting, and slept on the floor of a hoarded house for the past 10 years. It all started one warm summer's day in mid 1996. I was brought into this earth spawned from a homosexual father and a woman you couldn't pay me to call mother. Nothing eventful comes to mind prior to the inevitable divorce of my parents. They were married 11 years before I was born and did not separate until 2000. I found out earlier this year from a document I found that my mother filed for divorce in 1992 but it was never finalized. Anyways me and that woman who birthed me lived with my grandmother for a little over a year, moved to a trailer, about an hour away, and one final move to my current residence in the middle of fucking nowhere. Even as a seven year old after the initial move I did not like it here. I was over an hour away from civilization and went to the public school for 10 years which was so behind a regular school that I learned more from self teaching myself online. My parent worked long hours everyday and I would punch mirrors and slice my finger tips open in frustration. My grandmother's house was my only escape. I would stay there every summer just to get away from my own place which I have not yet mentioned is hoarded to the ceiling with completely useless garbage. So yeah I went through 10 years of school without developing any social skills only able to talk to a few people. My severe anxiety kept me from even asking the teachers for help even today. Anyways back to my grandmother. I stayed at her house every summer even right after highschool when she was killed by a drunk driver 3 miles from her house. She was a 4 time cancer survivor and my only escape. I was very obese from the time I was 4 till the time I was 18. A product of me being fat was no desire to leave the home and I completely blocked out my father's family for no real reason. I had always planned to lose the weight after highschool because I didn't wanna do it to fit in with all these people I didn't care about but to better myself. After I lost the weight literally everyone in my immediate family would bother me and tell me I don't weigh enough neglecting the fact that I am 5 foot 7 and should not weigh as much as other people of average height. I was never anorexic while I lost weight and I ate every meal. Yeah there were long periods when I was starving but your body has to adjust to not eating whole lasagnas every day. My family bothering me about my weight made me binge eat thousands upon thousands of calories everyday and I still haven't stopped binging and purging. Despite losing weight through diet and exercise I now have terrible posture and even tho I weigh about 130 pounds if you looked at my neck only you would think I weighed 300","So yeah no social skills , never had a job , milking my mother 's money forever becos she neglected to raise me , cry evertime I have to look at myself in anything other than a front facing angle . 20 years old laying on the living room floor of a trailer with shit piled to the ceiling .

If youre up for a read, Ill tell you about a situation that happened to me the other night. My moms birthday was within the last few days. I get very bad singing anxiety in general.

She reacted like my reaction was extreme and came out of nowhere. I honestly think its because rather than brush it off to keep the peace, I relayed exactly the same message at a volume and in a tone nobody is used to. My family tried to side with her and I continued to say that I dont know why everyone feels its appropriate to do at someones party, to say to someone on their birthday, or why it is necessary to do this at all.

"Everything I've ever found on interacting with people with ADHD has been for parents of ADHD kids, and partners of ADHD significant others. And the rest is for folks who have it. Mine's mild, undiagnosed, and generally under control, but I have a parent that presents with some pretty extreme ADHD symptoms and who is almost in complete denial about it. My relationship with him has been very rocky over the years. Growing up, I was often forgotten when he started hyperfocusing on new romantic partners. My college fund was also more or less gambled away, and I didn't find out until I was already a year in. In my adult years, my father is a dreaded houseguest who never cleans up after himself, breaks things for lack of patience in handling them, and is always declaring boredom at every quiet moment. And in the past year, maybe 2, he hasn't once called me. I always have to initiate contact. We live about 1000 miles apart. Basically, I've gone 30 years of not being exciting or important enough for him, despite his insistence on remaining a strong, loving fixture in my life. The only time I ever felt like a priority was the few short years when he was single. I have no siblings, though he has had step- children. I'm not looking forward to trying to maintain contact as he ages. His expression of ADHD seems to be getting worse as he gets older somehow, he seems to have more restless energy in his late 50's than he did 10 years ago, and on top of prioritization organization problems, I've noticed memory problems that I think can be more attributed to lack of focus than something like Alzheimer's, though getting him to think about getting tested for a degenerative disease like that would be impossible anyways. I also don't think he has hardly any money saved for retirement despite making well into 6- digits, and I worry for him financially","My father has really bad ADHD , is in complete denial about it , and it made my childhood quite miserable .

I have had many long term relationships and some short term ones that were ended for reasons that weren't even related to BPD and I never struggled to understand how to feel about them, or such apprehension towards being with someone. It is probably because of the last few persons I was with one massively Grade- A Asshole who ruined a lot of my things through being a slob and gave me some lovely parting gifts in the form of an STI, the other an emotionally unavailable nice guy that have got my abandonment defenses raised high.

"r relationships sent me here. I have an aunt, a blood relative, who I have always been close to. She often watched me as a child, played with me, listened to my imaginary stories and even participated lol and I still see her fairly often for coffee. I always considered this a great relationship, but recently a memory came up, one I guess I repressed. It's really not just one memory, but a series of them, and I never thought about it all until now. When I was about 4- 5- 6 I really, really don't remember , we had this game where we were role playing popular TV shows from that period. The whole point of it was me playing to be the main role, a girl who keeps rejecting the advances of an older, influential man. It was fun for me because I got to play this self- assured, confident, rich girl who does as she likes. However, the way it would end just seems to be the opposite of it all. In the beginning, it would end with us just cuddling which in itself isn't abnormal - in our culture, it's normal to cuddle kids from the family, but after the role play game it apparently became something else which signified the girl I played ""giving in"", as in stopping the argument with the man. It could have been just a way to make me shut up and get me to fall asleep. But once, it ended with a peck on the lips - and this isn't a part of culture. The next time, it was a series of lip pecks. I don't remember anything else at this time. What can I do with my relationship with this aunt now all is well between us and is there something I should to to ""take care""of myself now that I've realized this?

"Several years ago I lost my job. My mom got very sick shortly after, so I moved back home to help her recover. That took a long time, so when I was able to find a new job, it had been quite a while since I had had any relevant experience in my field. I now live in a relatively small town where jobs in my field are few- and- far- between. For example, before this week, it had been over a year since I had been on an interview, and the interview this week was for a job over an hour away. They were supposed to call me back to schedule a follow- up interview by 5pm today. It's now 5 30. In the initial interview I was told that I was the only person who had responded to their ad. So it's either me or the position stays unfilled. And apparently they have decided to leave it unfilled. After talking with the guy for just a couple of minutes, I knew I wasn't going to accept the position even if I was offered it, but still. If I felt like I was actually worth anything, this would probably hurt more than it already does. A few years ago I started talking to a guy who I thought I might actually have a chance with. We had a lot of similar interests, but there were enough differences to keep things from getting boring. I really liked him. But he lived 12 hours away. And because of my mom, I knew nothing would probably ever come of it. We ended up drifting apart and not talking for a couple of years. But I never really got over him. And then one day last month I get a message from him out of the blue. I kept telling myself not to expect too much this time, but my heart won out over my brain. Then I found out that he has.I'm not exactly sure what they are, but I know they're at least FWBs. So in the last week or so, I've gone from ""Hey look! I can see the light at the end of the tunnel!

"First time poster - if there is a better place for my question please direct me there. Thanks in advance. I started seeing a psychologist that I thought was a psychiatrist as I was seeking medication. She diagnosed me with PTSD and a ""dash of depression"". I really enjoy working with her but she is pretty much against medications for certain illnesses and I feel that the methods she is recommending to me aren't working. I would like to switch to a psychiatrist but I am concerned about how it would go. Do I have to be re- diagnosed? As in, would I have to pretty much make all the progress I've already made with my therapist with my new psychiatrist? I am also interested in trying medical marijuana as I have used marijuana in the past and did notice a lack of nightmares and lessened anxiety. Im concerned about coming across as a druggie or something as I have numerous family members that often brag about their abuse of prescribed medications not marijuana by just claiming anxiety. I am typically skeptical of people for that reason, so I fear people seeing me like that too, even though that obviously is not my intention. How would I go about asking to try it? I've never been on medication for mental health before. Thanks for any advice!

"I'm an A and B student at a top 10 school who is good at math, music, English, and science lectures. I can't hack labs though, and struggle much more than anyone else in chem, orgo, and biology labs. I've only gotten A's because of excessive time limits or leaning on a partner, but in my orgo 2 lab I'm barely at a B- . I'm okay with my hands and I understand everything that's happening in lab, so it's not that I'm not capable of doing the work. But when I do lab work, I struggle to make lists of steps in my head, lists of ingredients and everything when everyone else seems to get it. I can't go anywhere in the lab without my lab notebook because I will forget the material or make a careless error 5 drops vs. 5 mL . So, sometimes I realize I'm working much more slowly than others, so I rush more and I everything up, including my results. Sometimes I also panic when I see new equipment I have to work with.

"I honestly don't know where else to go, but I feel that I need to just stop bottling up all my emotions before I end up actually following through with these suicidal thoughts. Ever since I was a little kid, life has been a pretty shitty experience. I've never meet my dad once I don't even know his name or if he's even alive , my mother has had shitty health pretty much since she's given birth to me, and being a first generation child, I have no family in the states that have been able to help out my family, and I've ended up living under the poverty line pretty much all my life. Though what has been worst is that I've been bullied almost all my childhood, and I've developed suicidal thoughts towards the end of middle school, but thankfully I was too young to properly grasp the concept of suicide and never followed through with those thoughts. Things got a bit better in high school, as I at least got along with my classmates and managed to make some friends, but any personal struggles I've kept secret from basically everyone that I know. Fast forward now, I'm 18 starting my sophomore year of uni and my suicidal thoughts have returned, but lately they've been far too intense compared to what I'm accustomed to. Since late winter of last year, on a daily basis, I end up having intense thoughts of despair and hopelessness, and twice I've come close to going through with committing suicide. Thankfully with perhaps the first time I've opened up with anyone about my thoughts, I was recommended to my uni's wellness center, and for once I was actually getting some help. I still kept this secret from pretty much everyone I know, including my mother, but when summer came around, I found out that my counselor was going to be gone for the summer, and as a result, I've had to basically deal with my problems alone for the summer, since I'm not particularly fond of well talking about my problems with well anyone. I went out of my way to keep myself busy this summer and got myself a internship as a way to keep myself preoccupied at all times so suicidal thoughts wouldn't be so overwhelming. Things have gone great at my internship, as I've started to learn to more about being more social and outgoing, and I was even offered to stay after the summer as a part time intern while I'm in school. I know I should feel happy and well accomplished, but to be honest I feel miserable. This week especially has been a terrible week, as one of the staff members in my office passed away, and death has perhaps been the biggest trigger to suicidal thoughts for me, as it reminds me of what could happen if I actually went through with those thoughts, and with the recent passing of Robin Williams, all I see on my facebook feed is nothing but status about suicide and depression and how no one should suffer through depression alone. I know I need help at this point, but I'm honestly scared shitless that I'm going to let down a lot of people, especially my mother and co- workers, as I'm the only one in my household who brings in any money from work, and I play a pretty important role in my company's team.

She has been very clear about not wanting to leave me either and that this isn't all there is to our relationship. She has struggled with self- harm herself, in the distant past, so I know she knows that it isn't about other people. At the moment, I honestly don't care for myselfI'm just in so much pain. So, I want to be clear about the following I believe she has every right to express her side - her feelings regarding this situation. And she should! Communication is so important. This is difficult for her and that makes absolute sense. Which is why I'm doing everything I can to make things easier for her. It's just thatI wish she had more to say now. Now that I've been self- harm free for 10 days. Or any of the other times I've resisted and stayed clean. It's at times like these that I wish it was clearer that this does actually matter to her that she isn't only saying the things she says when something has happened because she feels like she has to. Has to ""care""about it. Has to guilt trip me into getting clean, because of some moral responsibility. Since I'm fighting for her, I just want to know that it matters when I winbecause if it doesn't, why should I fight? I don't have it in me to fight purely for myself right now.

"I want to try to find therapy for my partner. I'm not sure if he has officially been diagnosed with depression, but its pretty clear that he does suffer from depression. Also, some anxiety, particularly social anxiety. He has incredibly low self esteem, even on a good day. He has had times where he sinks into a kind of paralysis. He becomes seemingly unmotivated, and the usual things he enjoys don't please him. In the past, he has had trouble finding a job has had trouble keeping a job and recently, he gave up on applying to grad school.

"Recently, I stumbled upon a few videos detailing the philosophies of Kierkegaard and Sartre. These works introduced me to the concepts of existentialism, nihilmism, and absurdism. To make things short, even though my life means nothing to me, it might mean something to someone else. In accordance with that, I feel much better about not ending my life. However, the problem that remains is still this I am completely and utterly useless. What's the point in being alive if I serve no purpose?

"Hello there, Sorry for formatting im on mobile. Okey so, i was diagnosted last year with ADHD and it really felt right since the symptoms fit and ive been told by many people they thought i have ADHD. My brother got tested some years ago but they couldnt really diagonse him. And i feel like my dad has ADHD too. But, here's the deal. I got started on concerta 18mg. And i felt no difference at all after 2- 3 months. Then I got started on elvanse 20mg. The first week or so I felt like there was some kind of calm in my body I had never felt before, but now Im not feeling that or my body has gotten used to it The doctor said the medicine would help me to have more energy to clean my apartment and do things instead of just get home from work and watch youtube until its time for bed. As well as be able to focus more on reading or drawing etc. And maybe have improved memory. I cant really remember what she said but it made me excited. But now, 1- 2months later I still feel no different at all. Not in the slightest. I read all these stories on here about how medicine changed their life and Im a little jealous since mine doesnt feel like its working. But now I feel like maybe i dont have ADHD bc the medicines arent working. My doctor said this medicine would definitely work but here I am.. Worth noting Im in sweden. And i take my medicine in the morning at 6.30 on mon- wed and more like at 10 the other days. Maybe i need to take it the same time every day for it to work? I also take sertralin for depression and risperidone for hallucinations. But my depression and my hallucinations are so much better now. I havent been feeling this good for years and i havent had a hallucination in 2 years. So i feel like neither would mess up the effect from the medicine.

"I'm honestly at the end of my line here. At 20 years old, you wouldn't think that suicide would be my most contemplated topic. I've always been a loner, that guy with only a few loose friends and one good friend to see me through. I think the most I've ever had at once was 6, nowhere near enough to warrant signing up for social networks that required people to friend you, because I didn't want to feel inadequate next to their several hundred people who they were friends with. So when I came out to my ""friends""as transgendered, it really wasn't much of an ordeal. The general reaction was one of utter indifference, so I thought nothing was the matter. That was about 8- 9 months ago, the same time I started my transition. But recently I've heard that one guy in particular, we'll call him A, has been talking behind my back and has effectively turned everyone against me. Incredibly vile things that my good ""Friend""was kind enough to clue me in to before telling me to get lost. On top of that, my family who are pretty hardcore pentecostal christians has already turned their backs on me. They said they could deal with my being atheist, but adding being a ""sexual deviant""on top of that has caused them to no longer acknowledge my existence. I can't handle this by myself. The company of fake people on the internet is not enough to get me through. I desperately need someone, anyone to provide the human interaction I can't live without.

"Hey reddit, I'm not sure exactly how to start this, so I guess I'll just jump right in. I am a college aged male trying to deal with crippling social anxieties that only seem to be getting worse. In high school, I was never that popular, but I was comfortable with my group of friends. I didn't worry too much about what others thought of me, I just kept on doing me, ya know? I might not have been the biggest social butterfly, but I had my friends and that was fine by me. Even in my first year of college, I was friends with almost my entire floor, and loved hopping from room to room to see what everyone was up to. It overall was a great year and I enjoyed every minute of it. This year is where the worst of the problem began. I still have my tight- knit group of 4 great friends 5 including me , but it has gotten to the point where they are the ONLY ones I can even interact with. At the start of the year, my roommate who happens to be one of my close group and I neglected going to the meet- n- greets on the floor, because 1 he thought they were a waste of time and 2 I didn't want to go alone. This proved to be a horrible mistake, because a few days afterward, everyone had already started forming friend groups where I was still unknown to all. Now I am not too bad at conversation at least in my opinion , my downfall seems to be meeting new people and starting conversations. Seeing as I don't know anyone, meeting 3 or 4 people at once is an even more daunting task. Once I've been introduced, I can usually do a decent enough job at small, friendly talk, but I just can't seem to break past that introduction phase on my own. Because I continued to be a recluse, it has just become an impossible task to meet anyone. My own actions caused me to construct an insurmountable wall of fear. I think to myself now, ""I can't just become open up now, that will just be weird! I'm sure they all think of me as that loser kid who doesn't speak! ""Now I pretty much only hang out with my core group, and only go out to parties and such if one of them invites me along. Otherwise I head back to my room for a solitary night of wondering what is so wrong with me. Even when I do go out, I can't overcome my innate fear of rejection and typically don't approach anyone I am unfamiliar with. Luckily for me, I have been granted a second chance. My roommate and I will be switching dorms next semester, and with all new classes, I will have plenty of new opportunities to make new friends. I just worry that I will fall into the same trap again and continue my self- destructive thoughts ways. ","I suck at introducing myself and opening conversations .

"Warning! This is my worst nightmare come true and is a bit gross So after dating this girl for 9 months and staying at her house numerous times, I finally worked up the ability to calm my toilet anxiety for long enough to go number 2 in her house.

"Ill try to make this as short as possible. I am in high school. Ever since elementary school Ive been lightly bullied nothing physical, mainly just exclusion things, cyberbullying embarrassing secrets being shared, etc once middle school came I started meeting new people and it felt great, but I noticed I was still stuck in my old group of friends and I would hang out with them even though I knew I wasnt being treated right and I was falling into a hole of sadness because of it. Thats when my drug abuse started happening. I would go out and get high every so often. Every so often turned into often. Often turned into weekly. Weekly turned into daily and before I knew it I wasnt sober for a good 3 months. Wake up get high, get high during the day, get high before I slept. That was my life. Keep in mind the new people I met were and are still like family to me. However, by the time I met them it was too late, I was already so fed up with even living that I was in a shitty mindset and the drug abuse was already happening. Alright so I finally managed to break out of that cycle. I stayed sober for months. I stopped hanging out with the people who were bad for me and I started hanging out with people who actually cared about me keep in mind during this time I hopped through like 5 different friend groups, so I was struggling to find my place I was also very insecure. So flash forward to these past few months. I got a girlfriend. I got a job. I barely see those who hurt me. Ive made new friends that are literally amazing, so now I have 2 different friend groups that support me and care for me. Heres what I dont understand I just started cutting. The other night I cut myself a few times and I want to do it again. Im beginning to abuse nicotine as well as weed again. If Im being honest with myself right now Im the happiest Ive been in a long time. I dont know whats wrong with me. I think I may not be able to accept that Im happy after being unhappy for so long so I feel the need to ruin it?

"yeah.. I have a very distinct memory of silently crying in my psych class junior year of high school, I don't remember what we were covering but I know it was family- related. my parents are both still in my life and have generally been caring and loving in their own ways, but they split when I was 4 I just turned 20 and still hate each other. it always bothered me that they couldn't put aside their personal bullshit to properly care for their one kid, but I guess that is kind of an unreasonable expectation as they are human too. in any case, I always get so scared for the future, because this toxic and negative relationship between my parents has been established in the norm in my life from a young age. I'm so scared of that being the precedent for my own relationships and their subsequent failure, and I'm scared that that is the environment that my future child will inevitably have to deal with. I feel pity for myself that I wasn't able to experience the childhood that many of my friends got to experience, and I am nervous that my child will end up going through the same experience as me. logically I know I'm in charge of my own actions and thoughts to an extent, but it still freaks me out that there's a part of this that is likely beyond my control",ya I cry for my past self and my present self and my future self and any offspring I may bear with a partner bc I 'm scared of fucking it up,"my parents split when I was 4, and I'm scared my child will have to deal with the same situation as me.","I'm scared that my child will grow up in a toxic and toxic home environment, and I don't know how to deal with it.","my parents split when I was 4 and still hate each other, and I'm scared that that will be the environment my future child will have to grow up in",0.2909090909090909,0.07547169811320754,0.18181818181818182,0.3793103448275862,0.07142857142857142,0.2413793103448276,0.3174603174603175,0.09836065573770492,0.2222222222222222
"My SO is paranoid schizophrenic and has been since he was a child. He's currently on Abilify oral 5mg and seeing a therapist. He recently switched from one therapist whom he'd been seeing for a few years to a new one. This new one has included me, to a degree, in his treatment by doing a few group sessions and making it open for us to have group sessions pretty much whenever and at our discretion. Now, his last therapist was awful. By the time they closed out his case and transferred care, it was essentially a one hour conversation about how the therapist was doing and his opinions on the world. Clearly not helpful. This new therapist you'll know this if you saw my last post is really trying to push the Abilify IM depot on him, much to our annoyance, and was originally talking about a partial hospitalization outpatient program read adult daycare not what we want either . Unfortunately, we live in America, and we aren't rich, and have very mediocre insurance, so we can't just pick a good therapist and have to deal with what we get. My problem is that this therapist doesn't seem to be discussing any sort of cognitive therapy plan to help teach my SO how to retrain his thinking or cope with the paranoid thoughts and occasional over the top episode type times. I really don't think this therapist is going to make a plan, but he'll at least have someone to whom he can feel free to vent. Anyway, my question is this have any of you found a cognitive therapy plan that has worked to help you deal with your paranoid schizophrenia? Are there exercises you find helpful or mantras that help? I'm always telling him he should meditate, but he doesn't, and I try to tell him to get out of the house with our kid during the day go to the park or something but he can find it really anxiety inducing if I'm not with him. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm hoping he'll listen a bit more if it's coming from someone who's used it successfully for a similar disorder","I do n't think medication should be the ONLY tool my SO is using , but our therapist does n't seem to be decent enough to prescribe cognitive treatments exercises and acts more like a confessional that throws out positive affirmations occasionally .

"Most my 20's were spent as a heroin addict. My life felt meaningless, I felt worthless, I just didn't know HOW to do life. Then I found out I was pregnant, went to treatment and have now been clean for 4 years. A couple years ago I knew I needed to get my mental health in check. My diagnosis had always been depression anxiety. So my doctor put me on Lexapro. My brain and life still just felt unmanageable. Boom! Wellbutrin. Well the depression was being treated without success so along comes buspirone. I finally started seeing a therapist. After a few appointments, she told me she was very confident that I had been misdiagnosed. She was pretty positive I had ADD. We talked about it, and it felt right. I started bawling because it felt like finally I could have a normal life. Now my doctor refuses to treat me. Since the typical medication is a stimulant and I have a history of drug use he flat out told my therapist no. I just don't know what to do.

"I've been feeling depressed for about 4- 5 years now and have never really told anyone. Sometimes I tried and they just talked about themselves or I tried getting them to notice with subtle remarks about how I'm feeling but I've never actually used the word ""depressed depression"". Right now it's getting worse because of a couple of factors or none of them, I don't really know. But I noticed on several occasions now that no one in my whole life has any idea of how I really feel. They don't know that I think about suicide several times a day and have been for the last idk how many months years. They don't know that even the slightest negative remark towards me which occurs quite a lot in my family makes me questions my whole life and if I'll ever be happy.

Everytime I think about talking about it with someone I feel like they won't take it seriously or think I'm overreacting whining about my life or that they won't know what to do say and will only feel bad themselves especially my bf . Another thing that stops me from talking about it is that when I'd tell them, they'd have something to hold against me. Especially my mum she can be VERY hurtful towards me sometimes not saying that I'm not too sometimes and that she'd maybe use that information to hurt me or make me feel bad some day.

"So lets set the stage first I'm a 31 year old male working in consultancy IT. Dropped out of school at 18, worked myself up to a senior technical position and looking to grow into a more architectural role. Which should involve less hands on and more planning the future of the IT infrastructure, and also being able to persuede people to execute my plans Today, I was just doing my thing while a new upper management guy enters the scene. He's talking about my colleague about some new functionality which he wants to have ""just rolled out""to nullify some inconvienience he otherwise has. I'm not going into detail, but for the purpose of this post I think this is a mayor overhaul in the way we work and we should discuss, plan and investigate if this is a solution before even touching a button. This guy is hardly 8 hours in and my coworker is already setting up a Proof of Concept. I felt I needed to speak up, which I did. This guy immediately starts how about it is more secure and it is more managable. Technically, he is not WRONG. But ""just winging it""is not a good strategy! However, due to he knowing what he was talking about and me not expecting this discussion, I was set back and unable to stand my ground. This happens a lot and I really think this is blocking me from moving up. I am a really good IT guy, I know what I'm talking about and this stuff always feels like I'm just walked over without being able to push back.

" TL DR at the bottom because this gets long Ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts and bad anxiety but this has pushed me a lot, So my cat was 19 and for the past few days I didnt notice until last night he hasnt been eating or drinking so my mum today called the vets and told her to prepare for the worst, so my mum and twin brother who suffers from dyspraxia so it probably made it worse are in tears, my mum puts my cat in the cat carrier and drives off, before she left she called my dad theyre split up but are still friends to come over because were not dealing to well with it and its his cat too. Im not crying yet idk how to explain it but I dont really cry a lot now I just have that feeling in your guts that normally happens before a wave of tears comes out. Later on in the day at about 5 30pm I live in Scotland my mum opens the door, and I hold my breath, but she walks in with no cat carrier and not cat in sight, she breaks down in tears and soon my brother and my dad who Ive only seen cry once and thats when my parents split up Im not crying yet but some tears start to form since I cant hold it. After my dad leaves I go to my room because Ill try and not make it confusing basically me and my twin used to share a room, hes currently got his own room just not fully done up yet because of covid 19 and its expensive, so my cat would sleep a lot on the spare bed. So Im sitting down in the room and see the fur from when hes molted think thats how u spell say it and the scratch up wooden beams on the bed hes an indoor cat and used that bed a lot to scratch and I cry a lot. I then go up to the scratch marks on the bed and start feeling them, now Im sorry if I sound crazy but I feel like Im going crazy because Im touching the scratch marks just because I want to feel remember my cat again. What I also do is I start stroking the air where my car would sleep on the spare bed, I know this also sounds crazy and Im scared because I feel like I am, I think I just dont want to believe my cat is gone. Why was my cat put down? Apparently he had liver failure or an infection and simply wouldnt survive surgery because as my mum described he was like skin and bones. I never said goodbye to him, I hate I didnt, I was to scared to look at him because I didnt want him to go, but something I noticed which I guess makes me feel better is, he looked like he knew it was his time to go, I cant describe it but he did, the same thing happened at the vets as my mum described, he was just curled up in a ball purring and looking up at my mum, almost like he was ready to go or saying its alright. I loved my cat, like any sane person would with there pet, I was his favourite person too, my mum tried to reassure us as these past few weeks where the best weeks of his life, he was happier than usual and I could tell, something I will miss is the fact that I was his favourite person, hed sit next to me, get me to pet him and try to distract me to give him attention the most, hes even jump on my bed and just almost hug me, now I wont get that anymore.

"Ive been taking vyvanse for the last two months, first on 30mg, now on 50. Since Ive been taking it Ive noticed an increase in feeling this urge to make myself take deep breaths, and on the flip side, like I cant exhale completely or deep enough. Its almost like Im forcing a deep inhale and or exhale because it feels oddly satisfying. Annoying and probably unattractive to anyone passing by, but physically satisfying nonetheless. I never get this feeling in the middle of conversation, nor do I wake up in the middle of the night to do this. It only strikes when Im awake and otherwise minding my own business. When I cant force it, Im in no danger of actually being unable to breathe. This has also happened a few times pre- vyvanse, but I figured it was from allergies or my light asthma, and it was nowhere near this frequency and duration before. On days that I dont take my vyvanse, I dont really notice this happening. Am I about to die or is this an uncommon but low stakes side effect?

"So emotional permeance is a thing where you understand that emotions can exist when they are not being observed. Similar to object permeance. I dont really have any emotional permeance at all. Like for example, my friend can show me so much love and care and affection but once they leave, I immediately start thinking oh they hate me they have never loved me and such. I have a best friend that i really love and care for, and we hang out a lot. He has to go to the army for service mandatory in my country and before going off, accidentally deleted all our chat. Right now Im so angry at myself because whenever I talk to him, I literally have nothing to remember my emotions and feelings towards him. It feels like Im talking to my moms cousin and I feel awkward and put off. I know he used to shower me with a lot of love and stuff but now I totally dont remember feeling any of that at all? It doesnt help that I dont have text message to read to remember what it feels like to have him as a friend, and what little screenshots and chats Ive saved invokes nothing in me. I feel empty and it sucks because I know I dont want to feel empty. It just feels like he does not care for me anymore and he hates me as well and Im so distracted with myself.

"Hi fellow redditors i think ? this is my first time writing a post so i'm sorry if i'm bad at this i honestly am too emotionally tired to really explain my situation in detail right now, but basically I have a very toxic mother who sees me as a plaything or a pet more than a daughter And if my window was wide enough I would have probably jumped out already, but that isn't the case and I'm too much of a weakling to consider other methods well that is one thing my mom was right about me like i've cut pretty deeply before but I don't think I could do it to the point of suicide my mom kind of keeps me on watch 24 7 she watches me until I go to sleep to make sure I'm not doing anything else and even writing this is getting me sort of scared because she could check on me any time. She's also tried to commit suicide in front of me as a sort of manipulation method, and also regularly antagonizes my relationship with my dad who is barely there and that limits the number of people I can spill my guts to in real life. I've made some pretty decent friends, two of whom I sometimes rant to we're like rant buddies expect my situation is worse but my mental health is still a joke i used to like mentioned before cut quite a bit, 99 because of her she once caught me with a scar and questioned me about it, so I told her that it was an accident where I was trying to open a bag of chips with a knife and accidentally cut myself after the incident she was like ""if you cut yourself with only this much stress in your life you're an absolute weakling and should be ashamed of yourself""so i threw the plan of possibly telling her about this in the future out the window i was super depressed back in 9th and 10th grade when I cut actively but mostly stopped in 11th grade and no thanks to her by sort of brainwashing myself into thinking I was happy, but I'm getting back into my depressed zone these days. I acted pretty decently to her and she was pretty decent to me too during the first few weeks of quarantine but my mom has really been pushing me back to my depressed zone these days. Like the level of toxicity in our relationship is to the point where I feel absolutely terrorized when I hear the sound of her footsteps as she's approaching my room. I feel so tired and so out of place in this world, and while my mom probably has some shit to say about me too things that I don't understand because she doesn't tell me everything on her mind and even when she does she sort of yells it out and I have a hard time understanding I feel like shit these days and a weakass bitch for being so emotional.

"I am 19 years old. I've been dating my boyfriend for 7 months. We were friends for 6 months before we started dating. So we knew each other really well. He's so great to me! He's very patience and very funny. We get along great. This is my first relationship. I've always been a worrier, but this is my first batch of full on anxiety. I've had worries here and there throughout our relationship, but nothing serious. But last month, we said, ""I love you"". Ever since then, I have been extremely worried about our relationship. I keep feeling like we were ending. We have been communicating about this. We pretty much talk about it every time we hang out. Which I dislike, because it seems to be my focus. But I just can't shake it. Sometimes we talk things out and I feel fine to hang out. Other times I just get so worked up. When we talked about it yesterday the one thing that made me feel better was that he was a little worried. It made me feel like I wasn't alone. He's a very relaxed person and never worries, so it makes it kind of hard. We talked about how my worries sky rocketed after the ""I love yous"", so we're backing away from it a little. Just not saying it all the time, saving it for when we really mean it. I think it makes me feel pressured to say it more than I feel it. He was of course fine with that! He's been so great and patience throughout my recent anxiety! I hate feeling like this. On Sunday, I got so worked up and nervous, I thought about breaking up because I couldn't handle the anxiety. But I knew things would be worse if we broke up. I'm unhappy because of my anxiety, not because of the relationship. I was just being irrational. I just get so nervous for us to hang out now, which never would happen before. I hate it, I just want to feel back to normal! My boyfriend and my mom keep telling me once I get past finals, I'll feel better. I'll have less worries then. But I'm nervous my relationship anxiety will still be there.

"Hi, So I don't know if what I feel falls under social anxiety or not, but ever since I could remember, I felt very nervous when approaching new people spontaneously for conversation. Even when I got to know people, I would not feel particularly nervous, but I had a deep fear of not connecting or saying something wrong. Now here the situation I am in college, and just gave a book for a class I took to a girl who used to live in the same dorm as me two years ago. Me being the social recluse I was never interacted with anyone that year, much less her. She seemed a really friendly girl when I went to give her the book. Surprisingly, my anxiety did not start coming up and I had a conversation with her. I actually gave the book to her for free because of a kindness challenge. This sort of became tbe focus of our brief conversation. Now I really want to be friend with her. I can talk to her via FB massenger, but I do know what to say. I initially asked her if she liked the claas and she said no. At this point my anxiety is starting to flare up because I am worried about how to keep up a sustained conversation without sounding creepy or idiotic. Can someone help me have a conversation?

"I guess I'm optimistic, I always look forward to holidays and spending time with my family and catching up. But it never really seems to workout that way, 2 out of 3 times by the end of it all I want to do is be alone and cry myself to sleep.

". So I have been struggling with my ADHD inattentive for a while now. When I was first diagnosed I was about 11 and was put through several different medications and it was eventually decided that a mixture of Adderal and Ritalin to get me through the day and my various after school activities would be best. This was done through a dedicated Pediatric Psychiatrist. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, things are going great but then I experience sudden and severe vision loss, I am taken off the meds immediately and my vision is miraculously restored within a couple months. This was really scary and as a result I decide to try to go drug free for a while. amp Fast forward again to about a couple years ago and I am at my breaking point with my symptoms and not managing well, so I talk to my GP and she decided to try non stimulants, through my own experience I was already anxious because I recall some really severe side effects as a child to non- stimulants but since it has been so long and there are some new things to try I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. We go through every non- stimulant she can think of with some really terrible results. To many of the medications I had very severe reactions both physically and mentally. At this point she tells me that there is nothing else to try and that she is unwilling to prescribe stimulants, which I get because there is a lot of abuse of them. amp So I go about six months - a year on nothing, I'm now 27 and my talk therapist recommends going to a Psychiatrist to get help since they are a dedicated mental health professional and I think on it. I finally decide to pull the trigger but when I go to look at the Doctor she recommended they aren't covered by my insurance. Furthermore when I look at the doctors that are covered I realize that my insurance only covers 50 on Mental health specialists in network and 30 out of network. Given the cost of the average appointment that isn't really something that my husband and I can reasonably afford right now, he thinks I should try a different GP first but I would prefer to avoid that if I can because she is really great in every other aspect beyond this and based on my experience I don't necessarily think that any other GP would be more willing to try different stuff. amp At this point I am feeling pretty desperate and am willing to try anything to alleviate my symptoms and if anyone has any advice I would be all ears. I've never really tried behavior modification so I'm hopeful that it would really help. The symptoms I'm struggling with the most at the moment are as follows amp - Procrastination I have this habit of seeing everything that needs to be done or things I want to do, then getting overwhelmed at the size of the task and shutting down and just not doing anything at all. This applies to activities that I enjoy i.e. writing, art, etc. as well as ones that are more just being a necessity as an adult laundry, vacuuming, dusting, etc. . amp - Easily distracted I will not remember to do something unless it is right in front of my face, otherwise it is out of sight out of mind, in example my husband might request that I do the dishes and I will tell him yea sure just give me a minute but unless I go do it at that moment I will forget about it which is really frustrating because then I feel like I'm not doing my fair share when I inevitably run across the full sink and remember. amp - Inability to focus I can be at work and working on a problem, then I suddenly remember something that I was supposed to do yesterday and forgot, then I get half way through that thing and remember something else, and on and on it goes. This leads to me just being mentally exhausted by the end of the work day trying to keep up and remember where I actually was on all of these issues. amp Sorry for the short novel, I'm just trying to be as detailed as possible to make sure that people understand exactly where I am at. Anything you guys can think of to help is greatly appreciated. amp","Was on stimulants as a child , had to go off for reasons . Was med - free until symptoms felt unmanageable .

"Im starting a new term at my university and I'm so worried because my workload is 2 essays a week and I literally cannot do that.

When I had one essay a week I could block out parts of the whole week to do it and it worked well, I get the reading I have to do done over first few days as distractability makes it impossible for me to do it all at once, then took 1 to 2 days to write the essay, and then 1 or 2 days where I could rest depending on how much reading I had to do. It takes me a lot of energy to discipline myself to sit and get my work done, so I needed the day off to rest, plus I work quite slowly due to it being hard to focus and get a handle on my thoughts a lot of the time so I did need the whole week to get stuff done.

"Hey everyone. Years ago, 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with ADD. I've taken various medications for it, and only one of them has worked for me and all of the others have had weird effects on me completely messing up my sleeping, and hallucinations. After I hallucinated, I took a lower dose of that medication for a while and stopped all together. Now on top of my ADD, although from what I understand ADHD is an umbrella term for everything, I have diagnosed anxiety around tests especially. But I haven't taken anything in a long long time, and I thought I was fine. However, the more and more I do things the more and more I realize that maybe it's effecting me worse than I thought the ADD I mean. So I have an appointment to talk to my doctor about various things, ADD being one of them. Because I've heard that I have to be referred to a doctor. It's been a long time since I've addressed any of these issues, and I'm a little nervous about going back to medication because I've been screwed over so badly by one of my medications that I haven't slept properly since it.

" I was recently diagnosed at 23 and while compiling my files for it, I collected my medical records. Apparently I was diagnosed at 2 1 2 years with hypersensitivity and social issues, at nine with 'very probably ADHD' and self esteem issues worse than those of 97 of kids my age, and at 16 with possible ADHD, Asperger's and an eating disorder depression. The depression is the only one my parents ever got me treatment for, and it backfired spectacularly up to something I suspect was ptsd, but.. You guess it.. Never got diagnosed or treated . My parents tried A LOT to help me. Like I was easily as much work as three or four kids. Never an issue to get anything I asked for or they suspected would help. But somehow never therapy. I'm beginning to think my mom has ADS too. Would explain a lot. Have suspected my dad has Asperger's for a while, too. They never knew though. So I guess the point of this too- long post is venting about the sadness of it all. Nobody is at fault here, but I'm kinda mourning a childhood without all this shit. Without hardly having friends. Without being such a handful. Without never fitting in. Without getting a burnout at 16 and then PTSD on top. Without inheriting ALL the issues from each grandparent, then being the only one able to translate",could have gotten help like 21 years earlier and ca n't even blame anyone because they 're probably not functioning properly either but did n't realize .,"I was diagnosed at 23, but I'm sad about not being able to have a normal childhood without all the shit that happened to me.","I was diagnosed at 2 1 2 years with hypersensitivity and social issues.

"I'll try to keep this somewhat short. I recently plead guilty to a felony sex crime. It was consensual sex, but the person was a few months shy of 18, and I was over 21, which obviously is against the law in my state based on the first sentence. It is not an allowable defense that it is consensual, because the act is a statutory crime. It definitely shouldn't have happened, but it did. I was drunk and have since come to realize I have a drinking problem, and I'm trying to remain in recovery. I'm trying not to live with the guilt and shame associated with this, because I know I can't change any of that now. I wanted to move forward. Look, I've been down this road before. I've seen what suicide does to hurt families and friends. There are still some things I enjoy in life. Yeah, it's selfish, but this is my life . All I wanted was to have a decent job, a family, enjoy life, and be a productive member of society. The sex offender laws won't let that happen. I've yet to get my assessment, which is what will determine if there are restrictions on where I live, where I go, etc. I will almost certainly not have to deal with that part. But what put me over the edge was after frustrations with even knowing how to find a job. I have a bachelor's and master's degree, but they are in fields that I am no longer allowed to work in because of my conviction. There are zero jobs that do not do a background check, and while it is illegal to not hire someone in most professions simply because of a conviction, no one is going to hire a sex offender. So, I thought, maybe I should go back to school to get a programming degree. I figured those jobs are in demand enough that maybe I could get employment, especially since there is no professional certification that I would be refused like if I tried to become an attorney, healthcare professional, etc. Anyhow, I stereotypically now live with my parents, and I have no money, so I look at the local community college. Even on that application for admission, it asks if you are a sex offender. There are no questions about any other felony convictions. You could be a convicted murderer they've apparently got no problem with that. So what can I do? I know I can work and do a good job. I held a quality job with above average performance reviews for the entire time I was out on bail waiting for a resolution to this issue. I realize alcohol was a big problem in my life, and I'm trying to learn to stay sober. But I can't live with my parents my entire adult life and continue to mooch off of them. It's embarrassing, shameful, and makes me feel like there is no purpose. As I said, I still enjoy some things in life, but what is the point of living when I know no sane, self- respecting, adult woman would marry a sex offender, when nothing but maybe a food service or laborer job paying minimum wage will hire me, and I am denied even the opportunity to further my education? If society is going to deny me even the chance to be a part of it, shouldn't I take myself out of it? Wouldn't the morally responsible thing to do to kill myself, so that I'm not a financial burden on my family and a source of their embarrassment and shame?","Recently became a sex offender for an offense that does n't even involve children , but now I wo n't be able to get a job , go to school , or even marry someone worthwhile . I understand that I would be hurting others , but would n't it be morally responsible to end my life since apparently society wo n't even allow me to become a valuable member of it ?","I was convicted of a felony sex crime, and I can't get a job because of it. I have a bachelor's and master's degree, but I am unable to work in the fields that I want to because of the law.

"When I see people trivializing mental disorders it makes my blood boil. Especially when it is ADHD because it hits so close to home. Nobody, not even my parents could ever understand what is wrong with me. I was a bright boy, but I simply could NOT focus for the life of me, and it made me feel so bad about myself because I truly wanted more from my life. I remember when I asked people for advice about should I take medications to treat my ADHD, everyone would keep telling me not to do it, how those drugs are going to fry my brain, and I'l end up a meth addict or crazy and how when they have trouble doing something they just breathe or play some music or go for a walk and rest. And for a long time I really tried doing everything! But I failed 2 years in university, and that was the final straw. I told myself, I might become insane, or fry my brain completely by the time I'm 40, but I would rather live 10 years in control, than live a 100 being nothing more than just an observer in my life.

"so before i start with the problem i wanted to point out some background and situations that made me where i am currently at. i'm a 26 y o aspiring art person that wants to get into the film and games industry but due to current paperwork processing of getting my work permit i cannot apply to those jobs. i'm currently stuck working at a small real estate as an Admin member of the company for about 2 years now and i hated every single moment of it although there are some small enjoyable moments . When i started working at this company i was the only one that handles the majority of small to big odd jobs examples order supplies amp services, I.T works, Printer and Scanner work, customer services etc. work from a 9- 6 schedule had made me stressed, tired and lost interest of making art or even having a proper eating habit exercise schedule. eventually i got a notice that i need to get back to school to keep up to date with my paperwork. But the company wants me to stay with them and so i did. Working at a high stress work place during the morning while also studying at night had given me less than no time to relax. i started to hated myself of unable to do what i was intended to do with my degree. i get depressed and sad whenever the boss lashed out if things does not go out his her way. i started to develop an immature habit in the workplace where my attitude of feeling unhappy would show throughout the day. i have discuss this with my parents about this but i do not think they understand of the current situation.

"Hello, Reddit. I am a 19 year old male with ADHD Primarily inattentive currently in my second year of Engineering in University. I have also made such a slew of bad choices in these two years that I'm not sure if I can recover from this spiral. Here goes At the beginning of university I was motivated and ready to get everything done, emerging from High School after doing quite well. I got quite a bit of loan money and I lived at home, so I felt great about that, too. I seemed to be pretty popular with people I met and did pretty well In the beginning. I had a solid GPA and got all of my work done, but I was stressed out and began to spend an excessive amount of money on headphones and other tech until my money was completely gone for the next year. I couldn't event stop myself, guys. Leading penniless into the next year, I got another loan to add to my considerable debt and vowed I would work harder this semester and save my money. Eheh I met a quite attractive, yet 11 years older than me Japanese woman I studied Japanese in a High School so communication was solid which I quickly fell in love with and moved in with. Things were fine until she got pregnant and hormonal, and then the abuse started This woman became abusive in every way even physically! mainly because she couldn't stand my ADHD behavior. She eventually had a miscarriage right before we were going to go to Japan to meet her family, but I still went and it used more of my money. In that timeframe I was pressured into marrying her because of her needs and culture and marriage was really easy in Japan Just sign a few papers . It turned out that she was still rather abusive even when not pregnant, but it was better. It didn't last for long She then got pregnant AGAIN even when I was being careful, and she is planning on going back to Japan because her money ran out and I will have to meet her there after my school year and stay there for a year because of the child. This is rough, but what is worse are my marks Because I live with her and she is so abusive and takes so much of my time, my poor ADHD brain can't handle the stress of home and the stress of school, so all of my marks fell to D's and F's despite a reduced course- load. I spend all of my time at school just dicking around instead of going to classes or doing work because I can't do it at home at all. I don't have nearly enough money to handle this. It can improve if she leaves I can focus, but the rent will be higher , but we will reunite in the future for a very long time because of this child. I fucked up. I just wish I had never made the choices I made or at least knew better beforehand",I spent all of my money and was suckered into marrying a mean woman that ca n't accept me .

"My obsession is completely imaginary. I feel I have an energy that I can control but it can be affected by other energy so I feel I need to do rituals to maintain the balance of my energy. It's much like a soul. It pretty much is. I feel it can get trapped in things like doors, taps, pictures, soda bottles, anything that turns off or on, can open and close, windows, etc. If I don't open and close turn on or off these things in exactly the right way part of this energy gets trapped and I have to open the thing again or turn it on or move it, etc etc. My rituals involve focusing on a single point and sending my energy there before I close a door, turn off a tap, leave any place, look away from something, etc. I don't like to look at people, if I do I look at them twice to neutralize the first time I look at them.

"This is a very interesting post, because you are giving very well reasoned answers, and appear to be a generally OK, high functioning bember of society. In other words, you do not fit the typical depressed suicidal profile. That said, I can't help but imagine you like a long lost brother of Hal 9000. You seem oddly robotic, detached from life. Don't get me wrong, that is perfectly OK ""Wherever you are, is exactly where you need to be.""I can even relate to that disconnectedness. But that said, don't think that your suicidal thoughts are somehow justified because you feel generally alright and don't fit the depressed person's profile. I'll tell you right now, if you are legitimately suicidal, there is something wrong. Period. How do I know?? You are HUMAN BEING. You have 5 billion years of evolution- tested DNA that didn't make it this far just for you to call it quits. Your genes have thoroughly predisposed you to fear death. To STRIVE to survive. If you do not fear death, as you say you do not, then I can only guess that some part of you is numb. Some part of your brain is carrying a burden it should not have to carry. Your brain has in it the ability to feel the same passions and feelings of liveliness that every living person has. You have that potential. Somewhere. Find it. You probably say you don't care to find it. You don't care to be ""healthy, ""to be different than you already are. But know that you do have it in you to care, to be different. Wanting that is the next step. Now, we're getting in to some philosophical territory what does it all mean? is life even worth it? If we all just want people to be happy, but death is what would make them happy, is it then ok?? Interesting stuff, I think. Sidenote I am all for euthenasia. In the future, as we greatly extend human lifespan, I even think the right to death will be a moral and political hot topic.

That wants to change. We're here to help you. Now, I am no psychologist, but I insist there has to be something. There must be SOMETHING in your life that makes you passionate, that makes you afraid. That makes you feel. You are not a robot. What did it feel like 6 years ago? What changed 6 years ago? What event? What moment? When you think about killing yourself this summer, do you feel fear? You know that life is supposed to be lived. That's why you are here. Because the thoughts in your head are at odds with the beliefs of society, with the DNA in your body. We can see it. I think even you see it too, even if you have trouble articulating it. Just remember, you can change your mind.

"I've been thinking of taking my life since januari. I have had suicidal thoughts since i was 13. I am now 17 years old about to turn 18 in 20 days. I have never talked about how i feel with anyone until october 2015, where i met a girl and she really understood how i felt. She was like a welcoming home to me. She explained everything and she understood as she had felt this way too. After a while she eventually forced me to tell my mom. My mother is a understanding and sweet and really loves me, like most mom's i guess. I said i wanted to go to a psychologist to my mother which she said was really great that i was ready to open myself to someone i guess. I didn't tell everything to my mother but i told some and i especially told her to not to tell my father about this. My mother called the clinic ""the psychologist clinic help center""for kids. They said that both parents need to know which my mother explained to me. I strictly said no. Long story short she told my father and he know nows. I started to go a psychologist, which i guess helped me some. Because she explained things for me how i should handle certain things etc. Gave me methods and so on. I did a test and it said i was depressed not a surprise to me. The thing is i have no problems in life. I'm smart, doing good in school, got a weekend job at a store. My parents make good money imo I get what i want kinda, a good life basicly in most peoples opinion. I don't have problems making friends. Basicly i have no problems i have no reason to be sad. I have weird view of the world. I dont really care about people except the close friends and family. I don't care about that people die thats the way of world. I don't find a meaning. Even what we acheive, we will still die mentality. When we die we die thats it. Even what we make of our lives. People say but make the best out of it, but why live through things and suffer. You will still and die and forget everything. I get you have fun times, we will still die. People will remember you, yes iknow but we still die. The only thing making me live, is that if i kill myself my pain will go to my mother, father sister and family.

"Sorry for the long response! I have the same problem. If it's an incredibly moving, emotionally charged film or show, I have a pretty good grasp afterwards. Same if I've seen it 5 times.

"I chose to give up my marriage instead of giving up my character defects . I sat in an Alanon meeting, heard what I would need to do to take care of myself in order to remain with a man I dearly loved, and I went looking for an easier softer way and decided the problem was his. I got sicker . got involved with a sober alcoholic who was even sicker than my drinking alcoholic husband, and made a thorough mess of the next decade of my life. By the time I had hit a bottom that I couldn't blame on anybody else and could have actually be a partner instead of controller enabler, he was dead of alcoholism at age 45.

"Those days when you wake up sad, unwilling to do any of the things you need to get done. Logically, none of the stuff is too challenging and by no means would make you any sadderand yet, you're still laying in bed trying to find the motivation to get up. For some reason nothing seems appealing, there isn't a single thing that you could do today that will make you happy, so what's the point of getting up at all? Now you're in bed like Oh shit, that sucks, I want to be happy so bad. What's wrong with me? So now you get stuck in this meta- cognitive cycle of thought trying to find the cause of your unhappiness. You begin thinking about thinking. Hopefully you can figure out why you're sad so you can fix it and be happy again and move on with your day D but you never figure it out and put the blame on your asshole brain and it's chemical imbalance. If it isn't an external cause, it must be internal, right? With the shitty realization that you'll be sad today regardless, you once again try to think of something, anything , that could make you genuinely smile today. You don't and the cycle repeats itself until you get a headache from overthinking or you are otherwise forced out of bed.

You finish one errand but the amount of effort it takes you to convince yourself to start another is higher than it was the first time.

"I dont really know where to turn for help with this, but I think this subreddit might be the best place. Ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts and actions for the last few years. I cant seem to remember much about my childhood, other than something I hope can be looked past by whoever views this post. I began engaging in homosexual behavior around 8 years old, and it seems like that is as far as I can remember. Problem is, I was homosexually abusive, if thats the right term. I would recieve oral sex from other kids in the neighborhood, without feeling the need to return the favor. It seems like I would just use friends of mine for sexual release. Im 24 now, and so far as I can remember, my life has been absolute emotional hell. I am overridden with feelings of extreme guilt everyday. I turn myself into the butt of every joke, and let people walk all over me because I feel too much guilt to stand up for myself. However, when I do attempt to do so, my emotions fly off the handle and I get overly upset at the situation Im in. I have never had a solid relationship to anybody, male or female, and I usually cant keep a job for more than a year. I seem to show no apathy empathy towards anyone else. Ive noticed that I approach people like I am better than them, no matter who it is. Either that, or I go out of my way to earn the affection of whoever is around me. I dont know if my parents have any idea if or what caused me to be homosexually abusive at a young age. Im pretty sure they have no idea of the things I used to do. They say they noticed a very stark change in my behavior, which leads me to believe they are just as confused about my situation as I am. From what I do remember as a child, I was different things to different people, as if I was trying to cover something up, or modify how people saw me. I still feel like I do that to this day, changing my behavior depending on the people Im around. Im not any good at psychology, but isnt there a defense mechanism that your brain uses to supress harmful memories such as childhood sexual abuse?

"I've been diagnosed for about two years now, and since then have tried at least a dozen different medication varieties, but so far none have had any real significant affect on me as far as I can tell. As of now, I've gone back to 40mg of instant- release Adderall, and every so often I'll notice it a little but not very often. Meanwhile though my sister and mother who both have extremely similar issues that I do I'd bet the farm they both have undiagnosed ADHD as well have tried doses as low as 5mg and had exceptional results. I'm happy for them, of course! It's just baffling to me because I've been putting in the work for 2 years to try and nail down what I'm doing wrong, and this just further confuses me. We have similar genetics, identical lifestyles and eating habits, but somehow I get less benefits from 8x the doses they need. Have any of you had problems similarly to this before? I'd just really like to know what else I could try looking into.

I have anxiety issues and depression, but I deal with those with my therapist. I take my vitamins, eat my veggies, and get good amounts of sunlight too. As far as medications go I've tried Stratterra, Adderall IR and XR, Ritalin, Concerta, Bupropion, Focalin, Gabapentin, Lexapro, Vyvanse, Abilify, Wellbutrin and many more at many doses. Some had maybe a subtle effect but never anything substantial or consistent. I didn't even notice side effects for any of them either, so couldn't even really tell if they were working at all, haha .

"I was born into a flawed family, my mom is bipolar and my dad has always been more of a couch potato than a father.

"This Christmas and New Year were very enjoyable. I've enjoyed my time off from school. It's snowing outside and I'm going to a Bulls game tomorrow. So why do I feel so salty? I don't know if this is what you'd call an existential crisis, some kind of a mid- life crisis, but I'm starting to wonder if those are one and the same. I don't think that there's a single cause of this feeling, but it boils down to a few things that I keep coming back to. I could spend all day writing and rewriting a post like this but I want to get this out of my system as quickly as possible so that I'm not sitting here ruminating over how bad I feel all day long Sensation of total detachment from the rest of the world I'm 34 years old and still in college. 2 years down, 2 years to go. Actually, it'll be 5 years when it's all said and done if I can get through it all which is a lot longer than the 3 years I was bargaining on when I took the plunge. I don't have much in common with my classmates, not because I feel like an ""adult""and resent being around ""kids""all day this couldn't be further from the truth, as I'll elaborate on soon but because I'm a whole generation removed from them and don't understand where they're coming from at all. Also, I'm by far the oldest student on campus, as far as I can tell. BUT I look a lot younger and blend in effortlessly. I've told people there my age and they've freaked out and treated me a lot differently afterwards. So I don't fit in with the underclassmen, but also can't pass for an adult or cash in whatever kind of ""respect""is supposed to come with that. I feel like a huge misfit and can't connect with anyone there. I come and go and no one really cares. I'm a total stranger to all my old friends, almost all of which have drifted away completely. My oldest friend doesn't really know the ""real""me at all, and whenever we're together it's like we're just playing out some game that we started when we were 16. He's moved on and has a real job and a wife and kids and a house. I feel totally inadequate around him and honestly feel like I'm intruding on his time and the holy and incredibly meaningful responsibilities of spending time with his family. The only other person I ever ""hang out""with is my drug dealer but he's in the same situation and I feel bad occupying his time in a way that makes me feel like I'm taking it away from other people who deserve it more. I can't ask anyone to come over and hang out because I have a complicated living situation right now. I'm not really sure what else there is to do, socially. School, work, my distance from everyone I know and everything that's going on, plus the depression that I've been living under since I was like 16 or even younger means that I rarely make the effort to be social in any of the ways that most people take for granted. I have a girlfriend but she doesn't satisfy my need to feel like I'm a part of some group or my need to feel like I'm ""out there""in the world having fun and living it up. And I hate myself for that. Feeling like the world is passing me by I've accomplished nothing in my adult life, and that's really pathetic considering how low I've been aiming all along. I want to make music but I've always been too broke to afford the instruments or equipment I need. And I get frustrated very easily! I've been making videos ","sentence or two .

"for those of you who take the time to read this- THANK YOU. Please, bear with me. I have yet to see a therapist and this post is mostly about my ex. Some background I've had periods of major depressive episodes as far back as elementary school. I told my family I was going to kill myself when I was 7 no joke. I consider my entire family to be depressed- mom, dad, brothers. I'm not suicidal, though. I've definitely considered it numerous times in my life- ""I should buy heroin from a bum on the street.""Maybe I should buy a gun.""Maybe I should jump- off this high- story building.""I almost drank myself to death in high- school- I would get drunk and pop random pills at any party I was at. I've never seriously attempted suicide, though. I always considered my brothers and parents to be similar- depressed, but able to deal with it. I knew of my brothers getting into drugs when I was in middle- school, but they were successful with their careers and education that I never considered it problematic. Until one of my brothers died from a speedball heroin cocaine less than a year ago. Anyway, my ex is depressed and suicidal. I was so invested in him and our mutual depression that I quit talking with family and friends. We nestled into a depressive cocoon. I don't want to delve into what worked between my ex and I and what didn't work. But I'm so consumed by how my ex is doing that all I do at work is read about suicide prevention, and we broke up a year ago.

"Hello, I'd like to know 1 if you've been on antidepressants, what kind 2 how did it modify your behavior and cognition thoughts, side- effects, how you act, react, etc. My official diagnosis is ADHD and bulimia 18 years of eating disorders .

Over the last ten years, I have been diagnosed with social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia, BPD with narcissist tendencies, borderline structure, anxious- depressive tendencies, depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. long list of diagnosis which seems to change The diagnosis of BPD happened after a suicide attempt while on antidepressants back then. I noticed I act ""crazy""on them the anger is terrible and the mood swings are intense, the suicidal thoughts are escalating, I act on impulses and I take risky decisions. One minute, I'm laughing, the other I'm crying, then I'm angry, without any external triggers antidepressants tested Zoloft, Effexor, Escitalopram, Trintellix Anti- psychotics makes me go YOLO and I spend a lot of money while being super zen about it anti- psychotics tested Seroquel, Abilify, Rexulti.

"Hey Gang, For anyone interested in an update, here's what's going on The woman who I reported for threatening our client with physical violence to make him be quiet and who mocked him for being autistic is not at work today. I heard, at the end of the day, one of leadership pull her into a private meeting. I heard the word ""hotline""and she got super angry and defensive, I couldn't hear the exact words on their way to his office, but she was loud as she always is and angry sounding which she always does and she's not here today. Not sure if I explained this, but I included her on the hotline for the actual physical altercation that she referenced as what could happen to my client again. So, because I hotlined her AND made a formal grievance for seeing her be verbally abusive, it's a possibility she's fired. If not, she definitely is on thin ice, and I am going to literally just be waiting for her to do anything untoward or remotely out of pocket to make formal complaints and I'll threaten to go to HR. We're in agreement that someone who mocks the voice of an autistic child in front of his peers and threatening him with physical violence absolutely should not be working with kids right? Right. So, if they don't fire her, I'm going to mention that it's not ok she still has a job. The male staff that I reported for the physical altercation that left bruises and who threatened to repeat the incident if my client kept talking about it is here today but not on the same unit as my client. He too should not have a job, and unfortunately, if management does not remove him from the premises and terminate his employment, I'm going to have to do the same thing, document and if nothing gets done about it, I'm going to have to raise the level of whistleblowing. My hope is that he will be found culpable for the injuries sustained by my client through my hotline call and terminated due to that. If that doesn't happen, remember, this system is heavily flawed in the favor of protecting the business and employees more than the kids. As of now, the halls are quiet. No one is screaming. No one is swearing. No one is pushing kids around or making them feel inferior. It's raining and all I hear is the sound of drops on the skylights, and for the first time in a few days, I feel at ease. I'm looking forward to my meeting with child protective services later today.

"So I ended up abusing my medication, my next psychiatrist appointment is not for some time yet, I was just wondering if anyone in similar shoes with ADHD has misused medication and what happened post in terms of your treatment, I am regretful for having done so as I had no intention of letting this happen and yet, i did So I have some deeper digging to do I imagine to work out exactly what prompted me to get carried away Suppose I was chasing something of a high but it wasn't until masturbation that such a thing even came to mind, when I first started my medication I pretty much stopped masturbating all together my medication was ritalin IR 10mg, living in australia so our regulations might be a little different where I am to most people, thing is I'm not going to lie about it, i'm pretty sure my psychiatrist already knows I ended up in the E.R. for overdose, mostly they just kept check on my vitals, gave me benzos to slow my heart then let me go in the morning after asking me a bunch of questions incl. who my psychiatrist was talked to the in- hospital psych and he said that I likely wont get taken off medication entirely and that there are options to help prevent me from further misuse extended release, a more limited supply on my script which would require me to refill more often, controlled dispensers ? but ultimately i'll have to discuss these things with my psychiatrist first and foremost, none the less, I feel super shitty about what happened because I binged through my supply and though I feel lucky to have made it out okay, I can't help but beat myself up over it because it was absolutely not worth it and a complete and utter waste of medication, which i'm paying for now. the symptoms are making it difficult to keep up with my employment especially at a social level but I sort of just tunnel it into a productive hyperfocus where i pretty much just bounce around all over the place making sure everything is running as smoothly as possible for everyone else, managers seem cool with it because i'm at least being helpful but I feel so out of place compared to everyone else and feel I have difficulty really fitting in and filling any one particular role that it makes me feel inadequate to say the least so yeah","I binged , regret it , am willing to compensate for the risk of it happening again in the future by taking preventative measures but want to know what I can expect from anyone that 's been in my shoes particularly in australia",I ended up in hospital for overdosing on my meds and now i'm paying for it but I'm not sure if i 'll be taken off the meds or if there's any way to prevent me from doing it again.,"I abused my medication and ended up in the E.R. for overdosing and now I feel like shit about it but I 'll have to discuss it with my psychiatrist first and foremost, none the less, I'm just wondering if anyone else has done something similar and if so how did you deal with it.","I binged through my medication extended release and ended up in the E.R. for overdosing, I'm paying for it now but I 'll have to discuss it with my psychiatrist first and foremost but I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences with misusing their medication and how they managed to get out of it, any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!",0.33333333333333337,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.24489795918367344,0.020833333333333332,0.14285714285714288,0.27522935779816515,0.05607476635514018,0.1651376146788991

"I am college age student in my last year of undergrad and have just started school over the past few days. I have seen my primary physician over the last few months about concentration problems and he recently decided to prescribe me ADHD medication. My doctor prescribed me two drugs, Adderall XR 10mg and Strattera 40mg. His hope, since school is starting up for me was to take 20mg of Adderall while titrating Strattera to 80mg over the next couple of months. So here is my dilemma. The adderall is great after taking it for a week and I am able to fall asleep as usual. The only side effect I have noticed is indigestion which has been remedied completely by tums. I just picked up my prescription for Strattera and I am really hesitating in starting it. My main concern is the side effects associated with it as well as the time frame in which my doctor and I will know it is working. While I admit to reading many users experiences which my have elevated my concerns , it seems as if, generally, the drug works with side effects or it doesn't also with side effects . With just starting school, it seems like a big risk for me in terms of school and my personal life. I specifically am concerned with the insomnia and fatigue, as well as the sexual side- effects as all of these would complicate my schoolwork and relationship putting stress on me. The black box warning also concerns me as I have had depression issues in the past in addition to a family history of it. Essentially, I think the Adderall is working perfectly fine, but I want what is best for me in the long- run. I realize there is no guarantee that I will get any of the side effects from Strattera, but it feels like a bad time to start trying drugs that may take weeks for them to start working. Should I talk to my doctor about my concerns or am I worrying too much about uncertainties? Having been recently diagnosed, I don't really know much about alternatives or other meds. Any advice or people in similar situations?","Recently diagnosed and just starting school .

"A bit of back story I suffer from depression and only my sister fully knows about it. I have mentioned it in passing to my parents but I don't think they've caught on how serious I am about it. I'm on medication but can't bring myself to tell my parents as it makes me feel like a failure and I also don't want to worry them.

I accidently sleep at stupid times during the afternoon and then feel guilty when I wake up and realise that I've wasted time. It's got to the point where I'm either not eating dinner or eating at 11 30pm at night and not sleeping until 3am which then makes me hella tired for work the next day and hence the cycle repeats. I don't have much support mainly due to not wanting to burden others with my problems so that is on me and really just want to cry and have a hug.

"Okay, so, I have a date with a girl I've been after for quite some time tomorrow. We are going to dinner out in the city and doing some other things as well getting drinks, walking around, nothing too crazy, it's a first date . I am sightly concerned about my anxiety triggering at dinner itself. Back in 2010 I had my first panic attack shortly after spending a very long and exhausting day with my girlfriend at the time. We had eaten before we went back to my house, that's when I had my first attack. Since then I have not been able to trace a ""trigger.""I've had them alone, in public, while eating, while not eating, while driving, while riding in a car, etc. However, I think because my very first one, which was extremely frightening and made me so nauseated I vomited, was in sort of a date setting and it happened with food I just get a little extra nervous and I'm at higher risk to have some anxiety, which means I sure as hell am not finishing the meal I just bought because my appetite is gone. I should also say, typically I don't get full on panic attacks anymore, my heart just starts racing, my hands might get cold, and my appetite goes away. With this particular girl I'm going on a date with tomorrow, we've gone out to dinner before and I had anxiety around her for the first time. I had felt a little off all day, so I don't even think the situation fully triggered it, but it kind of amplified it. I hardly touched my food and couldn't finish my beer. When I told her I was having anxiety she was surprised and said she would not have been able to tell if I had not said anything. Does anyone have any tips on how to prepare myself mentally ahead of time?

Every phone call with her always ended in how disappointed she was in me, that i was fat, ugly, not girly enough, or how she wished i could just be a ""normal""child. The cps was involved a lot in my life and freshman year my father abandoned me because we got evicted from our apartment. He didnt have a job so moving from one house to another was the norm. He left me and i wound up living with three separate familys, one after another kicking me out. Eventually i moved in with my on and off boyfriend Spencer just so i could get away from all the different familys. I still talked to my father every once in a while on the phone. But my freshman year in college he called me and threatened to kill me so i transferred, changed my number and spencer and i moved closer to my mom so he couldnt find me. Now here i am 3 years latter. Three months ago Spencer broke up with me and then i found out he had cheated on me with his best friend during our relationship. He spread roomers about me to all his friends, used me financially, offered me money for sex, tried to bully me into letting him off the lease, and when we had first broken up brought his now girlfriend over to my apartment and had sex in my bed. During all of this, the only person who has stayed by my side is my mother. When i was in high school i inherited 75, 000 dollars, I've blown it all with spencers help. Ive never lied about anything to my mom except for this and only because she once mentioned that she would disown me and never talk to me again if i spent it. Recently i broke down and told her about it because i try really hard not to lie to anyone because it just causes problems latter on. I had gotten into a accident recently with a guy who wanted to turn into the parking lot on the right side of the street even though he was in the left hand lane. There were no witnesses and basically we're at a standstill with the insurance company. Im also in the middle of moving and trying to get spencer out of my life. I feel like i have no friends to turn to, my ""best friend""is never there for me and whenever i talk to her about anything she always turns it back to her and never really gives me any advise. I'm extremely depressed at this point. My mother keeps telling me how shes disappointed in me that i got in this car accident and how im stressing her out. Part of me wants to just be done with everyone and everything. Just delete my facebook, move somewhere else, and get a new number and just be done with everyone and everything. Suicide is not an option because i dont think i could ever cause someone to go through the same thing i did when i found my step father. I dont really know what to do at this point.

"I'm sorry but this is gonna be a jumbled up mess, I just want to write everything without worrying about making it ""in order""amp For as long as I can remember I haven't been feeling emotions as normal, it feels like I'm stuck running on auto- pilot and I'm so so sick of it, I wanna be able to feel happy and sad like I used to back when I was a little kid but it feels like I'm gonna be stuck feeling ""neutral""forever like I'm trapped looking at everything in my life happening from 1000 feet away while someone else decides what my stupid mouth says and what I think, I just wish I could be the real me in front of people, not some mindless dumbass who has trouble getting out the words ""Thank you.""to strangers. The only time I feel remotely in control of what I'm is when I'm alone in my room. Even trying to write a CV to apply to jobs, I end up having to lie in my hobbies to make it seem like I don't hide in my room away from the outside world playing video games like the nobody I am. Day after day it's the same, I apply to low- level retail jobs with my half- empty CV and when I hear back that I haven't got the job I'm surprised like I was expecting an employer to see I failed everything in secondary school, have one hobby and no skills and think ""I'd rather choose this guy over someone who has experience.""amp I'm scared to set foot out of the house and I get pissed at myself for it, I only read the parts of the news where people are killing each other over race, torturing and cutting up their newborn babies, shooting happy families and so on and now I assume everyone I walk past could be a crackhead waiting for me to turn my back and stab me. I know it's my fault but I have trouble escaping it, news is on the TV, news is on the newspapers in convenience stores, news is on Reddit and all of the news sucks ass. amp If I didn't have people depending on me, I would've killed myself the way I planned all the way back when I was around 16, I had the train times ingrained in my mind, which train platform I'd go to jump from and I had made a lie I was gonna tell my mum before I left ""I'm just going over to see my friend at the park, we'll be back in a few hours.""and I had planned to keep the suicide note under my favourite shoulder bag with one of my shoes on top of it to stop it from flying off since the only thing I really have in my bag is paperwork from years ago and then I'd get super close to the end of the station where the train goes the fastest and just jump into it hoping it'd kill me instantly. My biggest fear about being hit by a train was being paralysed in a hospital bed and having my mum and brother visit, how would I explain any of it to them? They still think I'm just a happy man who's down on his luck a little and will find a job soon and make them proud but I'm not, they have no clue I've been praying to God to just let me die in my sleep and I don't even believe in God, I'm just looking for an easy way out but life is never easy. amp It's awful and I hate it but sometimes I see posts about people with parents that hurt them or kick them out and shun them and I wish I were them so I would have a real reason to off myself but I was born to a great mum and she's the only thing keeping me here as of now, I know that if I killed myself all of a sudden, she'd blame herself for it even though I haven't shown a single sign of being depressed or suicidal to her or anyone else, she deserves a much better son than me for sure, she deserves someone who'll be able to get a well- paying job and be someone that can find the words to cheer her up when she feels like shit.

"I've made much progress in my healing journey, really facing the initial trauma and all the emotions associated with it head- on seems to be helping the most, but I find myself time and time again running into a problem. My problem is that I can't feel comfortable around anyone. Ever since my childhood trauma in which I was punished with rape after being sexually abused by my loving father I find myself disconnected with my ability to love or be loved. This, consequently, results in me being unable to feel safe comfortable around anyone, whether it be friends, family, strangers, anyone. This has serious repercussions in my life since a part of me craves loving relationships and to not be alone, yet my traumatized parts are so afraid of being re- traumatized, I can't fully relax around anyone. I can force myself to be around others, and the hope would be this would desensitize my reaction to people if I had enough safe interactions, yet the trauma was so severe as a child, every attempt to overcome this reaction has been thwarted by my PTSD. So I come to you for help, because I literally don't know what to do. I currently live with my grandparents, who are loving and understanding towards me, and do their best to make me feel at home. Intellectually, I know I'm safe, yet emotionally I cannot feel safe. The only time I can feel 100 safe is if I am 100 alone. Else- wise, when I am around someone, I shell up, I feel myself dissociate and sort of enter a mild form of auto- pilot, where I act loving and do everything I can to prevent myself from being hurt again, when there isn't any real practical danger. This not only adversely affects my family friend relationships, but this also impacts my ability to work. The mere act of going hiking on a trail is triggering because having to run across people on the trail gives me spikes of anxiety. So I suppose my question is this do you have any advice on overcoming this deep- rooted people- anxiety? I've realized living is much more painful than it should because I feel that I must always wear this mask around others, but putting on a show 25 8 is exhausting, which results in my wanting to isolate to rid myself of these anxious feelings.

"I'm pretty sure I have some form of anxiety. I feel like I'm walking around with a constantly racing heart. I'll feel I have to pee even though I did it just an hour ago. I'll feel anxious for no reason. Even when I'm sitting in a lecture hall, with class mates I know and feel fairly comfortable talking with, I can have a racing heart and feel anxious. Thing is, I don't really see how I can alleviate it. Whenever I feel my heart racing, I try to breathe through my stomach. It helps a bit. But it just keeps coming back. It doesn't seem to matter how many times I've been in the situation before. I can still behave normally though. I don't panic. But it's uncomfortable, distracting and bothersome. And I feel tired all the time, even if I slept enough and try to take care of myself. That bothers me a lot too. In general, I'm a pretty anxious person. I worry about my future a lot. I'm unsure about my sexuality too, and I'm thinking way too much about it. I just want to let it be and sort itself out, but it keeps bothering me. I've never had a real job amp I don't have a driver's license and I'm turning 20 in a month. I've never had a partner, nor gotten laid. I'm just afraid of doing new stuff.

I still couldn't sleep cause my hunch was telling me something was wrong I dig deeper and realize she met him 6 months ago and was cheating on him with me and not telling me about him so I told him about it with her presence and it went cool but I still couldnt sleep. So 2 days later yesterday thursday I decided to call him again I dont know why depression and sleep deprivation it went bad and he literally threatned my life or to at least beat the shit out of me and told me and her to never talk to him again. the next day today my exgf told me to basically fuck off and blocked me on everything so In a moment of intense disorder I threaten to post her nudes everywhere and basically tell lies about her and destroy her life if she ever talks to him again because I thought he was really bad which I would never do if I were in a good mental state . 7 I have to visit my mothers family in 6 hours I have to take care of my father this sunday tomorow and on monday morning I have my first interview and IDK how I will be able to do any of these.

"Posting on mobile. I've been struggling with anxiety for years but am currently having one of the worst panic attacks right now. I have an issue with guns ever since my teenage boyfriend threatened me with one many years ago. Long story short I decided I would go paint balling trying new things and trying to break out of my shell with my boyfriend and his best friend. We get here and it's extremely male dominated and that made me uncomfortable right off the bat. I kept feeling like I was being judged stared at by everyone. We go to play and the match starts and I just went into panic mode. I froze and all of the men on my team were screaming at me to run but I just started hyperventilating. It was hot, the mask was constricting and the guns felt real in my mind. It was just a bad experience overall, not to mention I shot one dude and he called me a cunt which just made things even more uncomfortable and ostracizing. I'm now sitting in the carI have been for hours. I told my boyfriend I couldn't do it anymore he's great, he understood but I just feel like a loser.

"Abuse is complex. Abusive behaviour, particularly at the start of a relationship, includes periods of being really nice and making their victim feel on top of the world. It's natural for someone to be drawn to that feeling, and the abuser uses it to manipulate their victim into putting up with increasing levels of unhealthy and abusive behaviour. The victim may suppress their initial feelings of something not- being- quite- right because the good times are so good and so much more frequent, or the warning signs don't make sense because the majority of stuff makes them feel good. The abuser will reinforce the idea that they're 'over- reacting' or 'making it up' when they try to address the negative behaviours, building up a pattern where the victim doesn't feel able to trust their own judgement or instincts. By the time the abusive behaviour has become so obvious that you'd think anyone could see it and leave, the victim has not been able to practise their own judgement skills or decision- making for so long that they either struggle to recognise just how bad the situation is, or taking action against it seems impossibly hard, a big and overpowering task. They may feel guilty or ashamed, as if they encouraged the abuse by going along with the behaviours that made them feel good at the start. They may be scared of change because this is all they know. And they may be scared of retaliation if they try and get out, because their abuser will have distorted their ideas about their rights and how people will respond or what can be done to help them. At this point, the abuser has often alienated them from their friends and family and outright lied to them about what support is available. They will have brainwashed the victim into believing that unhealthy behaviours are normal right 'the way everyone does it'. And every now and again, when the victim makes the brave step of trying to stand up against the abuse, they'll turn on the charm and make everything wonderful again for just long enough to destabilise the victim and get their power back","Abusers get their victims addicted to behaviours that make the victim feel loved and happy , then use this to manipulate them into ignoring bad behaviour until the victim is trained to no longer able to make judgements for themselves , and , like an addict , they minimise the bad stuff and chase the disappearing good stuff . It 's hard to leave because they 're not used to making decisions for themselves and their abuser has distorted their worldview so they genuinely do n't believe things will be any better out of the relationship .","Abusive behaviour isn't one - size - fits - all. It's a long - term process, and the victim may not be able to recognise it until it's too late. They may be too scared to take action because they've been brainwashed into believing that their abuser's behaviour is normal'and that they're just doing it the way everyone else does it.","Abusive behaviour isn't just a matter of'being nice ', it's a whole lot more complicated than that.","Abusers manipulate their victim into putting up with increasing levels of abuse, brainwash them into believing that their behaviour is normal and acceptable and that they can trust their own judgement and instincts to make decisions for them, and make them feel guilty for not standing up for themselves when the abuse becomes too much for them to handle.",0.3717948717948718,0.07792207792207792,0.21794871794871795,0.14414414414414417,0.01834862385321101,0.07207207207207209,0.4105960264900662,0.08053691275167785,0.2119205298013245

However, I took it on the chin and thought at least I hope I helped him get some hot food and hopefully not help him feed his addiction. That night, I woke up to my house alarm blaring. I just assumed someone was closing their window and accidentally set off the alarm. The next morning, I couldn't find my wallet for college. I started to panic. I realised that the back door was open. The lock had been broken and someone had run into my house, panicked because of the alarm and ran off with my wallet.

"I 22f lost my dad a couple months ago.. I seem to have suppressed most of my emotions towards it. However I think I did this because the first time I actually broke down because of it, I got told by my boyfriend that I shouldn't care because of how my dad treated me in the past. Since then I've kinda been Afraid? to react.. I hate hearing how I should feel. I ended up breaking down 2 other times about it, both times my boyfriend got mad upset with me.

"I am 17 and male. At the age of 6 my psychiatrist step sister suggested thatI have adhd but My parents said ""he is just excited to see you""I don't see her often then never did a follow up or even think about it. Years later when school becomes boring I notice I procrastinate until the very last minuet and I have trouble staying on task but I just think this is normal and Im just last. Recently I was going through a symptom guideline I saw for adhd I realized that nearly all of them apply to me and much of the symptoms apply to me strongly including inattention to detail, forgetting where I put stuff, forgetting my train of thought, having great dificulty starting and doing tasks that are boring and not being able to pay attention to conversations especially if they are boring or something else in front of me cold entertain me even if it is just ripping a piece of paper .

"Hi everyone, This experience happened a year and a half ago yet I'm still fearful that I may have caused some sort of damage. I was 20 years old at the time this happened a year and a half ago with no prior medical history had been prescribed methylphenidate er for studying. Can you guys give me your thoughts about the particular doses used and as to whether you think I'm okay? Basically, ever since this happened, I have this horrible fear that this experience gave me a heart attack long term damage. Doctors, psychologists, and cardiologists have told me I'm fine but I just have such a hard time letting this go. I would appreciate your input. Anyways, at one point I had a small tolerance which brought me up to taking these doses without much of a problem. But at the time of this experience, I had zero tolerance built up. Also, I've never abused drugs and I only used ritalin to study so my intentions were harmless. I had no clue these dosages were high are they? Here's the story One day at 16 00 4 00pm I took 40mg of methtlphenidate er, followed by 40mg er again at 02 00 2 00am , then 1.5 20 mg er pills at 10 00 10 00am that's one 20 mg er pill another 20 mg er pill split in half- I know, stupid . At around 14 00 2 00pm I was totally convinced I was having a heart attack - chest discomfort, pain under left armpit, shortness of breath, extreme nervousness agitation, rapid heartbeat, etc. so I went to the school's clinic. The nurses there didn't seem to know what to do which made me even more nervous. Then when the clinician came in they told me this is a clinic not an ER we can't treat you here. It was almost as if they were reprimanding me and telling me there was no hope. They also did not seem to know what to do and weren't very supportive so I was freaking out. They called 911 and paramedics came. At this point I called my mom frantically because I was sure this was it for me. I couldnt stop pacing the room. All of this lasted about 30 minutes - 1hr give or take, and nearly all symptoms were relieved when the ambulance arrived and I was given a saline IV. Once I got to the ER they took vitals, drew blood, EKG, etc. everything came back normal so they released me almost immediately. Diagnosis panic attack but I had never had a panic attack before. Chest soreness persisted the following week. 1 month later I have several smaller panic attack episodes and starts to develop severe anxiety, including health worries cardiophobia and OCD. I got a full cardio EKG, stress test, holter workup about 2 months after the original episode and everything came back normal. But I'm still convinced obsessing that I may have had a heart attack. This event has scared me so much. I will not touch another drug of any kind because of this. I feel like there's no escape from this and that I'm doomed to die an early death. Kind of how I was feeling during that moment. I should also note that I didn't have any sleep, hadn't eaten much, and was actually worried about something like this happening right before I took the last dose. Anyways, what do you guys think? Thank you for taking the time to read this and let me know if I can help in any way","took 40 mg of methylphenidate ER , then another 40 mg 8 hours later , then 8 hours after that took 20 mg and an additional 20 mg pill split in half .

" Triggers binge eating, self harm, deployment, violence Hello, first time poster. I am a 23 year old newly graduated teacher working full time. Im married. I like guinea pigs and have a lot of them. I live in the Midwest. Ive been taking medication for anxiety since I was a sophomore in high school. After moving away from my childhood hometown of 10 years to a town 2 hours away, I began self harming and generally spiraled into a deep depression. Once I was seen by a psychiatrist, my mom, myself and my doctor talked about my childhood, and we came to the realization that I had not acted like a typical child in many respects- I never could sleep, I would get headaches so bad Id throw up, I would have meltdowns before going places and before big changes. I would cry so much my eyes would get puffy and I would be inconsolable. I was pegged as a sensitive child and my mom did her best to work with me without really knowing my anxiety was so bad. Since being 15 and getting diagnosed, Ive been through a lot of things and come out the other side thankfully but many things still haunt me as anxiety is known to do. A brief sampling - Turned to food to cope with anxiety and became obese still am , eventually diagnosed with BED. I still struggle with this. - Struggled a lot in college and shut myself off from everyone- diagnosed with ADHD and went on stimulant medication which I still take. I fit a pretty classic example of combined type ADHD where I struggle to maintain attention and have signs of hyperactivity like talking too much - Tried to find approval through other people, especially the opposite sex and met a man who was addicted to drugs and alcohol and I briefly was involved in these things which forever changed my relationship with my catholic family, esp my father and sisters. The man has since done a lot to get his life together and weve been together 4 years and married 1 year. - struggle with addictions like pornography, internet, food, sleep- anything to numb - Strained relationship with father who deployed to the Middle East last week I dont know if any of this is important, but I figured Id say it. I do have anxiety attacks at least monthly and sometimes can have some rage things where I feel so angry about how I feel and how I want things to change. I had a goose egg on my head from hitting it against the wall a couple weeks ago. Biggest issues - losing track of thoughts and actions to more severe degree than just ADHD - obsessive thoughts about anything and then anxiety about them I worry about killing people but I dont want to . These obsessions change frequently. - Difficulty with depersonalization and feeling out of body a lot , I question reality on a daily basis, even if its just fleeting - Food and diet. Im 260 lbs and 5 ft 8 in - GIANT mood swings - constant tension. I get bad back and neck pain from constantly tensing those muscles - I have difficulties with hoarding and keeping things clean. You cannot see the floors in many places in my apartment. Theres trash and too many things. Its bad. I take vyvanse, lexapro and Wellbutrin. I dont want to stay on all these forever, because I want to have children and cant take them while pregnant. But what do I even do for medication??? Idk anymore. Oh I also see a therapist once a month who is working on intense CBT and other therapeutic measures with me. I cannot go more than this due to insurance",have complex anxiety and other mental health conditions and do nt know what to do for meds .

"Hey, Looking for tips suggestions on how I could make 300 this month! Im desperate! Im at the end of my wits with my life. Being diagnosed with ADHD was an eye opener but it has gone untreated since I can not afford the medication. Recently my life has started to fall apart! My marriage to my husband is on the verge of ending. Im struggling to keep on top of every little thing and hoping he will make up for the lack of memory structure is pushing us to the edge of no return I am absolutely desperate to get my life organised! I want to have a giant space in my kitchen to organise our life but for the life of me I cannot get my head around it. I cant even get started. Its all just too overwhelming and even when I try to break it down into smaller steps I just cant stay on task or make sense of it. My house is a mess! I have begged my family to help me sort it and get it to a point where its clutter free and organised. My sister told me she would do it if I paid her 150! Im struggling to hold down my job. Im a part time proofreader editor and reading through blocks of text is becoming unbearable! I just cannot focus long enough and keep up with gruelling deadlines. My relationship with my sister fell apart over Christmas after our mom was in hospital and I couldnt meet up to her expectations in taking care of our mom. And to top it off its looking more and more like my daughter may have ADHD too so she has her own battles shes fighting and Im desperate to create some kind of routine and implement strategies in her life to help her thrive. The problem Im facing is that I cant see me being able to make anything right with the extra help medication will bring. I dont expect it to be a miracle cure but I need something to help me direct focus and organise elements on my life so I can make sense of it all. I need to find 300 so I can afford the appt with my psychiatrist and the initial prescription charge for my meds!

"Everyone is occasionally going to have a Defecit of Attention. Unless you're some kind of a robot that can maintain laser focus on your topic of choice, nobody has perfect levels of attention all the time It's the last D that makes the difference. Disorder. A disorder is a condition that has persistent effects that negatively impact your quality of life. Having lapses in attention is normal, having a persistent deficit of attention is a different thing altogether. It's the difference between walking into a dark room and not being able to see, versus being blind. We don't say 'everyone is a little blind' just because everyone has moments in which they can't see. That would be dumb. We also don't say that person is exhibiting symptoms of blindness. Sometimes people can't see, that's normal. Sometimes people don't pay perfect attention, that's normal. The same thing applies to being 'a little OCD'. That's not a thing. And being particular about certain things is not the same as having a disorder. Not necessarily related, but it's another common one I see ","a momentary lapse of attention or ""exhibiting symptoms of ADHD as it was phrased in the post does n't mean you have the Disorder called ADHD","Everyone has a Defecit of Attention, but it's the last D that makes the difference.

"I have an issue that has affected my life for a long time now. I'm 19 years old and I always feel stuck. It's especially prevalent when it comes down to learning something.

I check myself probably too much and I feel like I'm always finding a lump to be concerned about. In the last week I've had a bruise- like pain in both of my breasts. On the right side, I can feel a lump that has only appeared since the pain has started. I also have a fibroadenoma in my right breast which I've gotten biopsied. But of course I worry that maybe they missed the right spot and it only tested benign because of this.

I'm currently living in a new country where the wait lists for a GP appointment are really long.

"I know I said suspected, I know you shouldn't self diagnose. I've been seeing a counselor for myself, grief counseling and just overall counseling and in the meetings where I have disclosed issues with my wife and how they have effected affected? me it has lead him to suggest her seeing a professional for an ADHD evaluation. Aroudn the same time, she found information online that suggested she might have ADHD. With that being said, she's currently seeking counselling, but also we have been reading this sub reddit and other online articles and we are 99.99 sure she has ADHD. Again, I know I know . The next part is difficult to explain, and I don't want to take up too much of anyones time. But essentiallywe had all these arguments in the past, and I'm constantly left feeling like ""why is she so difficult""why can't she see where I'm coming from""does she even realize what I do for her""and when we argue she's constantly defensive, interuptive, at times it's like she refuses to be understanding, and it's maddening!

Recently, after this realization of, ADHD should be considered, we have done a bit of ""research""and the level to which her and we, can relate to the posts on this sub, well it's a little suprising to say the least, as well as encouraging. I have now taken this newfound knowledge perspective and applied it to past arugments issues and have a ""oh! ""momentshe's not lazy, she doesn't not care about methere might be something else going on! And since this moment I have been better equipped at dealing with the ""little""things and our arguments haven't been so combative. Howeverit's still extremely exhausting for me. Like, we were able to have a conversation without it turning into an argument and she basically told me paraphrasing 'anything that you think needs be done cleaning, organizing upkeep is just never in the forefront of my mind, and i never think about it, and I just don't expect myself or you to take care of it, so if you get mad that I didn't do something, it's not cause I don't care, or I don't love you, it's just so far from crossing my mind that I don't even know it needs to be done""I severly butchered exactly what she said but it's very close the point, or at least how I understood it. I have a renewed patience in a waya different kind of patience. She has said she's been looking for a counsellor, and from what I've been reading I really can foresee that being a huge benefit to her, and us.

"A lot has been going on. I've started a new medication, and in the same week what was I thinking my partner 21M ADHD- PI and I 19F ADHD- C got a kitten. I got a very bad case of the puppy blues and reached out for support in some other subreddits, even suicidewatch when it got REALLY bad. I got criticism and laughs though which really knocked me down, and this is the only supportive place I've really found so here goes. I'm hoping that even though my symptoms are my responsibility and I am to blame, you guys will at least empathise or understand. When I first got him, I didn't bond at all. I'm a dog person but bond to most animals very easily, so this was a surprise to me. When I've bonded with animals in the past dogs and surprisingly chickens , I can handle an insane amount of extra work. They really help my mental health. Getting him was only semi- impulsive. We'd thought about this for a long time and planned, but impulsively didn't think through the current situation which has added a lot of stress to both of our lives. I'm pretty much out of work, just started ritalin which has made me tired and unproductive so the apartment is a mess , have hit peak assignment season at uni, and my partner has lapsed back into depression in the last week. I'm struggling with the disruption to my home, the smells of his food and sounds of him scratching, plus my anxiety about him getting hurt. I also and this is terribly my fault have him without permission from my landlord. Long story short, my lease says yes pets, my landlord says no and doesn't give a reason. This is stressing me out a LOT. The extra tasks I'm having piled on me are getting too much partner works, and is helping best he can . I'm having multiple panic attacks every day, and I'm having suicidal thoughts every morning and night. Thank god that you can't really off yourself on ritalin. We've really considered rehoming him. My partner fell in love with him instantly and now I'm falling for him too. He's a really good cat, which makes it all harder. If this doesn't work out, it's entirely my fault, will break my partner's heart, prove everyone who's told me that I'm too irresponsible for a pet right and not to mention will break my heart too. I feel broken and incapable, and I'm an absolute mess. I'm barely eating because food was difficult thing for me to start with. I'm at such a critical point and if I let things slip away with uni or apartment upkeep I'm doomed. We're keeping options open to rehoming him but it's going to be absolutely hellish, but I know it might be what's best for him. Right now though we're in 'see if it improves' mode","I got a cat , realised despite planning I 'm not a good pet owner at this stage of my life . Been suicidal over it and life is dally apart .

They are the usual difficulties that most students have, including procrastination and an inability to focus.

"So, to start this off, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar type 2. For any who don't know, it's more focused on depression. It's crippling. 4 or 5 months of super productive mania, then I get so depressed and angry that I literally can't function. I become the most selfish of people, I fuck everyone over, and I make life impossible for myself. I have a psychiatrist, he's got me on Lamictal and Trazedone. Lamictal as a mood stabilizer, and Trazedone for sleep. I'm still building up to my full dosage of Lamictal, and it might have to go. I've developed a rash which is a serious side effect, and could be potentially life threatening. This combined with my current crippling depression may cause me to lose my job. My parents are ready to kick me out on my ass, because I've been a douche. I know I have. I just can't help it. I have nowhere to stand on. No firm support. My own father told me to ""go ahead and kill myself.""I'm not emotionally, or physically stable enough to go to work an 8 hour shift today. The Lamictal complications combined with what I believe to be serotonin syndrome have yet to talk about it with the psych, but I have all the symptoms and the abuse history to back it up, took ssri's for depression and abused dxm super heavily for about 2 months. could lead to a very early death. I need to be hospitalized. But my own parents won't take me there because they think I'm lying. I feel like committing suicide. I know if I don't go to the hospital today or tomorrow, this rash and this possible serotonin poisoning may be the untimely death of me. If I go to work, I'll get fired because I am not productive enough to be there. And with good reason. They'd be justified in firing me. My head is spinning and I'm in a blur. My Bipolar depression, prescription complications, and possible long term serotonin syndrome are causing me to lose everything in my life. I have no friends. Literally no body. The only person I talk to is one of my managers, and lately that's been about boosting productivity. My father wants me gone, my mom and my sister have wanted me to leave for months. I'm losing my house, my job, my friends, my family. I'm becoming nothing. I have no clue how to proceed. I got accepted to my university of choice, and I'll be heading there in about 6 weeks. But until then, I have nowhere to live, and nowhere to lay my head. I may sell my computer and buy a car, but a 5 foot 11 kid living in a car causes lots of other problems, like nowhere to shower, no money, back problems, delusional from lack of sleep, and more","feel like death emotionally and physically , about to lose my place of living and my job , have no support , my own family wants me gone , to never come back .

"Hmm, this is a pretty hard one to answer. I dont know anything about your friends experiences, and Aspergers manifests in many different ways. What I can do is try to give examples of what I would do in that situation. My best advice would be, honestly, to turn your thinking around and go for the clich option. If you focus on the negatives and then focus on how overcoming them made you stronger, it paints you in a much more sympathetic light, and gets the reviewer to root for you. Then when the happy ending hits, theyll be overjoyed, and I dont know anyone who isnt a sucker for one of those stories that hit you right in the feels. Combine this with a few comedic moments to balance out the dramatic ones, and theres a very good chance youll come off as relatable to an NT that otherwise might think that could never be the case.

"I know every person does stim- like things, but I'm starting to think the things I do are over the top not typical. Every time I feel an intense emotion not necessarily bad, sometimes it's excitement I shake my hands in an aggressive way, think shaking hands after washing them if no paper towels. I also blink in aggressive and unnatural patterns, rub my eyes over and over again, and rock back and forth in similar situations. I start doing these things subconsciously, and can stop if I need to, but I'll feel unreasonably anxious if I do. Sometimes when the urge to do these things is very strong and I make myself stop, I'll have a full blown panic attack where I have to shut myself in a quiet dark place for about and hour to get control of myself.

"This semester has been the best and the worst few months of my life. Outside of school, my life is amazing! I'm a capable, enthusiastic, and proactive member of society. People see that and think that that translates to my academics. It does not. Since transferring to a 4- year university with academically rigorous coursework, my grades and plummeted. Intense anxiety and depression regarding my classes make it impossible for me to finish any substantial amount of work. The work I do hand in does well and proves to myself and my professors that the issue is not that I'm stupid. Again, I'm incredibly proactive, so I've tried innumerable methods to combat and circumnavigate my inability to do work. Every time something starts to work, it either takes way too long to finish assignments or it only works for a short time. When I try to work I'm so overwhelmed by hopelessness and anxiety that I have to put it away. Not being able to do my work meant that I couldn't participate in class, let alone understand the conversation, so I stopped going in order to avoid looking like a silent fool. The guilt from not going to class in addition to not turning in assignments made it almost impossible for me get out of bed and face the day. I've been able to regain that portion of myself. I love getting up in the morning and ticking things off of my to- do list. I'm just too deep in my academic shithole to climb out. Now I'm struggling to contain the fallout from my failure, prevent it from continuing happening again, and plan for the future","I failed an entire semester , my university seems to be working against me to soften the blow , and I do n't know what to do .",I can't get out of my academic shithole and I'm trying to figure out how to fix it.,"I'm a capable, enthusiastic, and proactive member of society, but I can't do work.

"This is a question I ask myself in agony every day. I think I have finally found my answer. Untreated ADHD. There's of course my depression, anxiety, and hormone issues, but ADHD certainly feeds into the depression and anxiety. I feel like I'm barely managing to keep my life together, and it's exhausting. It's like treading water, using every ounce of energy just to stay alive. How do people do it? How do people just live? I'm chronically overwhelmed, and I can't seem to keep up with the daily pace of life. Simple things that we're all supposed to do regularly overwhelm me. Getting up in the morning. Brushing my teeth. Showering. Doing the dishes. General cleaning. Doing the laundry. Putting my stuff away after taking them out. Getting ready for bed. Even switching into pajamas at night. I absolutely dread these things, and they make me want to die when I think about having to do them. Except these are things that need to be done regularly. Often daily.

"I've had this condition since 9th grade, so it's been about five years now. It's holding me back from what I know I can become. I've lost jobs, friends, girlfriends, motivation, and worst of all, who I am from this thing inside me. I've done all the research and I've explained it time and time again to those who I think would believe me. Over time, I've refined my personal description of what DP DR feels like and after I write it down I'm gonna explain how I think it works. So here goes As a DP DR sufferer, I am living in a dream, except it's a bit of a nightmare. In the movie ""Inception, ""one can travel into dreams within dreams. Let's call these ""levels.""When you experience DP DR, you exist and dwell within the second level, only going to the third when you sleep at night, and never going back up to the first level which we would consider reality. Our inability to escape from within the second level is impossible because we are awake and living, not sleeping. When you have DP DR, sleep is your ally, because we feel normal in our dreams. My acute onset of DP DR happened when I was high. My heightened sensory level left me prone to paranoia and anxiety. When I was caught smoking shortly after, extreme fear set in. The only extreme fear my brain has ever experienced was in nightmares, therefore my brain equated that experience to a nightmare. Since I can't wake up from a real- life nightmare, my brain is now stuck in a defense mode. During all of that, there are things that are happening chemically in my brain that I cannot express due to my lack of a medical degree, but I can paraphrase to an extent what I think is going on. When my brain went into defense mode, the area of my brain that controls thought, action, emotion, including the inhibition of inappropriate thoughts, distractions, actions, and feelings, was suppressed through some mechanism in some way. Through my research, it became apparent to me as though all of the symptoms of DP DR can be explained by a deficiency in the prefrontal cortex, that area in the front of your brain right behind your eyes. My theory could also explain the constant fogginess or pressure in that area, a symptom of DP DR","I 'm trying to connect DP DR to a deficiency in the prefrontal cortex , connecting my symptoms to what a damaged PFC would cause . It lines up to me . I would extremely appreciate any feedback , comments , questions , and concerns . Remember that I am not a doctor , and I 'm just trying to make sense of it all with the resources I have . I found lots of information about the prefrontal cortex on wikipedia , along with DP DR . Thank you all ! ","I think DP DR is caused by a deficiency in the prefrontal cortex, the area in the front of the brain that controls thought, action, emotion, and emotions.

"So I've been thinking of suicide. But that's as far as I've gotten. Just thinking about it. I'd like to leave this post behind in case I start getting more serious about it. If it's alright, I'd like to give some of my life story. I'm asking for permission because to be honest I just found this subreddit, so I'm not sure if I missed a rule about what I can can't include in my post here. Here's hoping it doesn't get removed. I'll do my best to not make this post too long, but I might get carried away. If I do, then sorry if I wasted too much of your time. At the very least I'll do my best to keep my paragraphs short. I might be going all over the place with this post though. Let's get started. I'm a college student and I recently moved into an apartment that's owned by the university. I'll have to take an extra year if I want to graduate on time, but that's if everything else goes well. I've been telling people that my graduation depends on if everything else goes well for a while now. I've changed my major twice. I'm taking a summer course to catch up. The last change of my major was done sometime during April or May. Why am I talking about college? Well, other than asking this subreddit if I could give my life story, I'm also mentioning college because my school life has gotten me to the point where I think I'm going to lose my mind. Or maybe I've already lost it. I said I was taking a summer course, but I haven't been wanting to do any of my homework. Summer courses can go by fast too. I tried doing some of the homework, but I had no idea how to do it right. So I put it off. The first assignment was due last week, around the time I moved into the apartment. The second is due tomorrow. The course is an online Java programming course. When I looked at what I was supposed to do for my homework assignments, it seemed simple. But when I actually tried to do it, I began to realize that I was completely clueless about a lot of things. I had taken an intro to programming course during the Spring semester, but for some reason I had already forgotten what a lot of the terms that were used meant. And when I looked them up again, the material didn't stick. Not to mention there was a lot to refresh on. Struggling with my homework started making me think about how I actually didn't have any useful skills in life. And what was worse was that it felt like I forgot how to think altogether. I didn't know how to problem solve or anything. The only thing I felt like I knew how to do was type words and punctuation marks. Why is my homework causing such a fuss? Well, normally I wouldn't think of it as such a big deal. After all, the reason I'm putting myself through this in the first place was because part me wanted to. But that's also part of the problem. Only part of me wanted to go to college, and only part of me wanted to go to college to work on homework. I made a half- assed decision without knowing what I was getting myself into, and now I can't take it back. And while the struggle with my inner self is happening, I'm constantly reminded of the fact that thousands of dollars that I never earned on my own are on the line for my education. I've failed a few courses already, and there hasn't been much improvement despite all that's happened. It's made the relationship between me and my family not so great. But then again it hasn't been so great even before I started going to college. There's a part of me that wants to be good at a lot of things. One of those things is computer science. I realized this recently. Before I wanted to be good at psychology. And before that I wanted to be good at electrical engineering. But trying to be good at a lot of things can be difficult, especially if those things are multiple branches of the STEM field. I've also wanted to write books. And learn foreign languages. And volunteer to help people. But I figured school was most important, so I haven't approached any of those other tasks seriously. Despite all these ambitions though, I'm also actually lazy and a quitter. Other times I just want to sit back and browse the internet and watch some shows or videos. I could do that for a good chunk of my life. But I don't think I'm allowed to. When things get tough, I give up. I might give up on college soon. Maybe I'll give up on life soon too. Or maybe I already have. I think I have a bit of an ego. When I think about doing something, I want to be amazing at it. But when I attempt to actually get good, I realize that it takes a lot more work than I think. And then I suddenly don't want to go through the trouble. I don't ask for help because like I said, I'm a quitter. If I haven't done everything that I could, then I probably don't deserve the help, in life or in some activity that I'm doing. I don't know about other people, but for someone like me, it hurts when you don't meet other people's expectations. And I'm starting to think that it hurts the most when you don't meet your own. I start thinking and talking big, and when someone knows about my failure it feels like I've just been exposed as a fraud and that I've let them down. It's a little different when I'm confident though. When I'm confident I get carried away and start saying and doing whatever I want without a care in the world. Sometimes things turn out okay when I'm confident. Sometimes things even turn out better than before. But society likes to drag you back down to Earth sometimes. If it catches you making a mistake, or even if you do something that seems stupid, it'll give you a hard time. I don't think there's a rule that says you need to be perfect, but when you're full of flaws, there are plenty of people who will pick at them and make you feel worthless anyway, and they don't even need to be aware of whether they're actually making you feel worthless or not. Supposedly there are ups and downs in life, but so far going down has gotten a lot easier than going up. I'm in college for a bunch of reasons, but I'm mainly here because 1. people implied that it was good for you, 2. I wanted the skills to get help people, and 3. I wanted to get a good job and become independent as soon as possible. I don't like being a burden to people if I can help it, especially when it comes to my parents. I wouldn't have minded working for a bit so that I could pay for college on my own, but my mom really wanted me to go, so I went and didn't think about the alternatives or consequences of not going. I also thought that if I didn't go to college then, I wouldn't go to college any time later in the future. So I went. And now I don't get along with my parents anymore. Actually, I probably don't get along with my whole family anymore. My brothers call and most of them just end up giving me talks about how the real world works and what I'm doing wrong or what qualities I should have. Things were fine before I went to college, but ever since my first year, a lot of my life seemed to be going downhill. I got a few bad grades, and as previously stated, I changed my major twice later on. My stepdad kept telling me that I should consider quitting and that college might not be for me. That seems like a smart move. But then he started giving me all these other suggestions. And I've started to hate the word ""maybe"". Maybe I should do this. Maybe I should do that. Maybe do some research on this. Maybe ask people about this. It's like a softer way of telling me what to do. But it's still a way of telling me what to do. But my mom really wants me to stay in college. She's very encouraging. When it comes to school. She talked to me about going to college since elementary school, and she was even the one who got me to decide on my first major electrical engineering. I did mention dropping out once. But my stepdad said that I needed a plan. Problem was I didn't have one. So it seemed like staying in college is a bad idea because I wasn't good at it and I wasn't happy there. Plus all that money that isn't mine is being spent. But leaving college without a plan also seems like a bad idea. So the solution's simple, right? Start having a plan. But the problem is neither my stepdad nor my mom considered my ideas to be plans. And even if I did have a good plan, there's no guarantee that nothing will go wrong. So they shoot down every single one. And then I start shooting down my own. I mentioned to them me moving in with one of my brothers and seeing if I could work with them or at least near them, because being around my parents only reminds me of how ashamed I am for not being a good student and how I feel like I let them down. They didn't like the suggestion. So what does all this lead to? It leads to my now possibly messed up personality. When I was a little kid I could talk to my family with ease. But now I don't want to talk to them about anything, especially my problems. When I talk it's as if people are trying to make the conversation their own. They only talk because they want to say what they want to say. My opinions mean nothing to them and it gets ignored or rejected. What's more important is that they say something that makes them sound right or intelligent. What's more important is that they make themselves feel like they're doing something helpful. It feels like no one is actually thinking about me, and when they do they're convinced that they already know me and how I feel. They don't care about how I feel, they only care about how I do things like how I live my life and how I'll benefit others. And this is why I'm here now. Everything I say is unimportant. Everything I do is either unnecessary or not good enough. But I don't always talk for people to agree with me. And I don't always do things to satisfy other people. But I also don't think I need to associate myself with people who drag me down. And so I got away from them. And now I'm alone. But I'm actually okay with that. Being alone feels nice. But even when I'm alone, I know I can only be alone because I'm living off of someone else's expenses. I only managed to move into an apartment because my parents are willing to pay the rent while I'm in school, and they're believing that I'm diligently studying to face against the odds and come out as a person with a better future. Except I'm not studying. And there's no guarantee that my future will be better, even if I do make it out of college. I might not even have a future soon. I haven't spoken about my problems in a while. But thanks to the internet, even if my opinions about my problems are rejected, it'll be by people who I don't actually know. And they won't know me. So that's why I decided to submit my post here. I feel trapped, as if I'm some kind of caged bird, and if I break free, I'll just end up being inside another one. And this will keep happening. Again and again. I've been suggested to just do what I want since it's my life and that I should care less about what other people say think feel, but I'm constantly afraid of just that. I don't like seeing other people get hurt, especially if I'm the one who caused it. It's worse when they take that pain out on me. I can't even call it abusive. And because I haven't talked about my problems with anyone else, it's put me in this predicament. It's been a week since I moved into the apartment, and I'm already considering dropping out for real. But I still don't have a plan. Since my parents just helped me move in, they'll probably give me a hard time if they have to move me back to their house again. I say their house because I never really thought of their house as my home. After all I don't deserve it. I'm still a child. The world is telling me to grow up. I couldn't grow up. So I pretended to act like I was. I pretended to be someone who I thought was strong and had a single, specific goal. But I want a lot of things. But I also can't have those things. Because I have to rely on other people like my parents. But that's why no one knew how I really was. In a world where adults tell you to suck it up, I'm convinced that talking about my problems does not help me and that it could even make things worse. In the end solving my own problems depends on me, but as long as I have to rely on people while they reject my opinions, I don't think I'll ever be happy. My problems are nothing compared to what a lot of other people have gone through, I'm sure. But that's why I haven't talked to anyone yet. Because I know this is just the equivalent of a child throwing a tantrum for not getting what he wants. Because he feels like people are being mean to him and he doesn't want to deal with it, so he's taking it out on some online post. Regardless, if you managed to read this far, I greatly appreciate it. Even if I don't ever actually talk to anyone about these feelings of mine later on, it's nice to get it off my chest. I don't think my circumstances will get better though. Even after typing all of this and probably making it seem like one big drama session, I'm still considering suicide.

"I'm a sophomore in high- school, good grades, raised in a fortunate family, only child. I have so many good things happening in my life, but recently I've just been feeling terrible for several reasons 1. Although Im generally a nice and friendly person, I don't enjoy social interactions a lot, and because of that, my only major group of friends are total assholes to me most of the time, using me as the butt of most of their jokes. As a result, I always feel worthless around them. 2. I go to an intense high school one of the top in the US and just don't have much free time to rest, and often times loose sleep because of this. 3. There's a girl in my section for marching band, and she's always been super sweet and nice to me. She's a grade above me, and has been acting pretty flirtatious with me for the past few months. However, I have a really unnatural fear of rejection, and am extremely nervous about asking her to homecoming, even though I know it's not to big of a deal.

"This is going to take forever, but okay I guess. Around four years ago, at age 18, I was living with my parents, on a whole bunch of drugs to treat me being bipolar. I hated living with them and hated the drugs just as much, so I decided that I was going to quit the drugs and then I was going to take a trip to visit all my internet friends before finally killing myself. About the same time I ended meeting a new person online and decided that I was in love with them. After about a month and a half of talking I wanted to meet this person, so I had him come pick me up and I would hang out with him for a day. I didn't let him know, but my plan was to really just gtfo of where I was at and talk him into letting me live with him. What a great idea that was. At the time it sounded better than killing myself, but it was a pretty horrible idea. I cancelled all the plans I had for my trip around the world and cut off all ties with my friends and family to go live with someone I barely knew. This plan is not as nearly as brilliant as it sounds. After 3 months of living there, life started to be not so great. He had some severe anger issues and made me scared to be there. After 7 months of being there I nearly committed suicide, but he held me down and stopped me while calling 911. I had decided to kill myself then for somewhat the same reason as now. Living with him has been a nightmare for me. Our personalities clash so much and he is so unbelievably lazy. Seriously, what did I expect? After the suicide scare, he called my parents, who picked me up from the hospital, but I actually told them to take me back to his house! I went to a free mental health clinic a few times, but hated it so much that I stopped. I'm rereading this story and realizing it has no continuity, I'm sorry I ended up getting a job which helped me a lot. It gave me something to do, and somewhere to be away from him. I started burying myself in things like video games and books to take my mind off my situation. After four years of this, I can't do it anymore. I have a job, but I have no car and am reliant on him for transportation to and from work. I tried going back to school to get some computer networking certificates, but am having such a hard time studying it seemed pointless so after one year, I quit. I feel like I can't help myself get out because I have no knowledge of what to do on my own and know no one who can help me. And now I reread this again and realize I'm only describing my situation and not even my real thoughts or feelings and it all sounds stupid and pointless. I can't even express my own thoughts. fuck it",I feel trapped in my living situation with nowhere to go and I do n't have any idea what to do or how to get out and be on my own or what would happen .

". So, today I took a huge leap forward. I have never been formally diagnosed with ADHD, but there's no question that I have it. I was never the ""squeaky wheel""like my brother was. This resulted in him being diagnosed when he was about 4, but I never was. My parents offered, but I thought that it didn't really effect me too much. I was wrong. I always thought that I could handle it on my own, but about 4 years ago I was about 26 I started to realize that I handled it very poorly. The only thing that I was able to do was to not make a fuss about anything. I could give several examples college, work, etc. where I did far less than I could have done if I could have gotten my brain to work better or if I understand myself more. Around that time I started thinking about getting diagnosed and seeing what I could do. I ended up delaying a bit. About 1 year ago, I started losing my grip on my mental state. All of things that had previously been subtle to me like anxiety, depression, etc. had suddenly taken center stage. It didn't help that my job, which had previously allowed me to do things that helped get up and move around, solve unique problems, something different daily, etc. , suddenly decided to change all of the processes to an assembly line. For the past few months I have had one of about 47 tabs open on Google Chrome on my phone looking for people specializing in ADHD Psychiatry. Today I finally made a call and scheduled an appointment! I've been meaning to do this for a long time and almost didn't, but I went ahead and did it.

"Yes, yes, yes! Diagnosis still in progress but very likely. Ive always loved little warrens and nooks and crannies, and had lots of hiding spaces as a kid. One of my favorite things to do at a family friends house for quite a few years when I was little, was hiding in her huge closet, there was an absolutely magical corner that was so soft and quiet and cozy, her scarves were hanging down and the space between the floor and where the scarves ended was a perfect soundproofed cozy cocoon. Or squeeze through her cat doors and tunnels and explore! In first grade I was bullied a lot and my safe space at school was the tiny space in a corner where two bookshelves came together at an angle. I could slip in between them and not only be hidden from the bullies, but getting that deep pressure contained feeling. My first job.I had a master key to all the closets and Id go hide in one if I felt a meltdown coming on.

"I am an anxious person by nature. I am having a major depressive episode and my anxiety is worsening because of a recent divorce and both of my parents having terminal illnessesand theyre both suffering a lot as they die very slowly. Lots of pain. Very little control. Head above water is my goal each day. I have alimony for a few more months, but all of this has derailed my life, career path, finances. All of which makes my anxiety worse. My boyfriend doesnt understand much about anxiety. He isnt affectionate or expressive, both of which I enjoy. Hes a deeds actions person when he wants to show affection, but fundamentally, hes quite selfish at his core. Something he admits freely and here and there claims to be working on. My anxiety enrages him. He says I take everything wrong but on my end, it seems like he is just really cruel sometimes and he speaks frequently without thinking about what he wants to say. And what he says seems objectively hurtful to meI try to read it without my anxiety glasses and still find some of the things he says really toxic and contradictory. Hes dyslexic and terrible at expressing himself. Ive read those two things mag be related, dont know. Hes very cautious and defensive. My anxiety and his defensiveness is a terribly mix and when they mix, you guessed it, he gets enraged. Then I get more anxious. As soon as I work myself off the ledge with tools Ive learned purposefully for this precise pattern, I still have an enraged boyfriend who speaks his mind and he often does so in anger. I hang on to what he says, in anger or no, and i try to let it go and I hear it. I really try. Nonetheless, I often hear the horrible things he says on repeat. Which cuts my efforts to calm down to pieces. I get more anxious, he gets more angry. We have some good days here and there when the cycle is in a lull, but it is pretty constant. I get more anxious, he gets more frustrated and angry and defensive, and I get even more anxious. He tried to smooth it over with jokes and cutsey things, but that goes over like a lead balloon with me. Seems like hes mocking my pain and avoiding our real issues. He is fearful- avoidant attachment style, I think. Im anxious- preoccupied, but I do tend to assume the worse of other people.

"I had a realization this morning. All my life Ive struggled to remember my schedule - really anything that comes in the form of a day or time. I have to set a million reminders, write appointments down, and even then I have a 50 50 of forgetting. Ive missed doctors appointments, important work functions some of my most cringey memories from young adulthood , and today I missed a hike with friends that was scheduled in memory of someone who passed away recently. If you were to ask me about this I would tell you Im not good with dates. I remember other things but time is hard for me to envision. Ive always been bad with appointments. So after sleeping through yet another social commitment and deciding to hide in my bed while I try to text my friends this morning I ended up googling forgetting important things and found myself on this sub, which Ive lurked on for so long.

I've been suffering from severe depression and PTSD from bullying for about 3 years and I was on medication until 2018 August. However, things got pretty worse past few months and the psychiatrist in my home country believes that I should start taking medication again that he told me he will transfer my medical record to the new psychiatrist in my college area. The issue is, it is a small town in the midwest and I only have two accessible psychiatrists in the area I don't have a car and both psychiatrists refuse to prescribe medication. One believes in naturopathy and told me to do botanical steam baths 7 times a day for 3 weeks. The dorm only has shower booths and I don't simply believe steam bath will just magically cure my depression and PTSD.

"I'm going to share my story first then ask questions later. Some of the questions require the story and some don't. When I was in elementary school I was your typical ADHD kid. Super hyperactive, no attention span, acting out, tantrums, trouble following directions, etc. I was am very intelligent but had a lot of trouble focusing that energy. While I remember very little from this time in my life. I do remember endless dr physiatrist appointments and my prescription being upped strengthened a few times. At some point in middle school I told my parents I was done with the meds. I felt IIRC bogged, almost dumbed, down. I just remember not wanting to take them anymore. Now I'm in my early 30s and am a productive and successful adult. I've worked hard to channel my energy towards work and I've gotten a lot better at not being affected. It does interfere with life at times with trouble concentrating, trouble listening, trouble sympathizing, trouble sleeping restlessness . As I mentioned before I don't remember a lot of my childhood to the surprise of family and friends. I work a very technical and high pressure job that I couldn't keep if I were medicated for ADD ADHD. Being that I've been successful as long as I have, I have no intention of seeking help for the few times I suffer symtoms. I find caffeine typically helps me cope with these things minus the restlessness at bedtime . I had a doctor recently say that somethings I mentioned at an appointment pointed to me being depressed. I was appalled and even asked friends and family what they though. They all disagreed with him. After some research, I do think I may be mildly, chronically depressed another huge no- no for my job and wonder if its a result of extended childhood Ritalin use. I don't feel they are bad enough to warrant intervention but I can tell they are lingering in the shadows. I also have two kids now. My older one just turned 4 and sometimes shows the same signs I did. However, we've found that if we limit foods avoiding wheat, high sugars, processed, and some other things she is a sweet, caring young girl. When she has those foods, it is like a switch, she can't concentrate, can't be nice, cannot control herself, throws tantrums over stupid things like cup color. Talking to my parents these are some of the things I use to do. I do not have my Dr records from childhood and wouldn't even know where to begin digging them up, and I really don't want to given my job","I was diagnosed ADHD as a kid . Now I cope w o meds . First child showing signs possible food reaction . Question time Is memory loss a side affect of Ritalin use ? Does caffeine usually help people with their ADD ADHD ?

"Hello, first time poster on this subreddit. I apologize if this is long- winded, but I have a lot of backstory to tell that I feel is relevant to my questions! My name is Chanel newly diagnosed with asperger's syndrome at the age of 25, but was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD ADD and generalized anxiety disorder a few years ago. I know I've had life- long anxiety problems from a very early age, but my adult ADHD diagnosis came as a very big surprise to me. The Asperger's diagnosis is something I stumbled upon while reading up on some literature for my younger brother who was diagnosed with Asperger's at the age of 3 years old when I came upon Samantha Craft's Aspie girls' checklist. Since being diagnosed, every tiny thing in my life makes sense. Every struggle, quirk, and quality I deal with daily lines up. I no longer feel misunderstood, or confused about why I struggle to relate to people around me, or why I always feel the need to act a certain way based on who I'm socializing working with. But the diagnosis has also brought forward some issues I never realized I was dealing with things like sensory overload episodes which were a common occurrence but I could never vocalize what I was feeling followed by bouts of anger and rage if I could not get away from whatever was overstimulating me. These issues have become much more prevalent in recent years since I began living on my own, and working as a full time registered nurse. I recently sought treatment for my overwhelming anxiety, as I felt like it was to blame for my sensory overload episodes. I have tried several anti- anxiety medications, however I seem to be rather sensitive prone to medication side effects. The side effects began outweighing any minimal benefit I was experiencing from the anti- anxiety meds side effects like flattened mood losing interest in all of my many hobbies, decreased libido, migraines, restless leg syndrome and related insomnia, and nausea weightloss. This would lead me to consult my psychiatrist, who would wean me off one med, and start me on another. It has been a long and frustrating process. During my most recent psychiatrist appt, my Dr recommended that I stop taking the last medication I was trialing wellbutrin , which we believe has recently been causing my overstimulated anxiety episodes to become a daily problem. He has since given me a prescription for a new medication called aripiprazole aka Abilify. Abilify is labelled as an antipsychotic medication, however in small doses, it has been proven helpful in treating patients with autism who are dealing with anger issues, anxiety, low moods etc. He suggested I start on a dose of 1mg for 1 week, then increase to 2mg daily. This is indeed a tiny dose, as many people take anywhere from 10mg- 30mg a day. Being a nurse, I research any medication before I start taking it. Although my doctor did mention a couple side effects, he did not mention one which I am very familiar with from working in a hospital called Tardive Dyskinesia- or uncontrollable spastic movements of the body.. Tardive Dyskinesia TD can often be irreversible even after discontinuing the medication. Although this side effect is rare, it has me extremely nervous. From what I've read, TD occurs in middle- aged women with previous history of antipsychotic medication use, and previous history of spastic movement disorders. So, here's whats getting to me I've had so many rare side effects reactions to other medications more than listed above in the past, including restless leg syndrome- which some relate to tardive akathisia a similar movement disorder that also relates to TD. Because of this, I'm extremely anxious to start taking Abilify, become affected with TD, and have this side effect plague me for the rest of my life. I'm not one to usually ask for advice over the internet, but I'm unable to see my Dr for the next 3 weeks, and I have no contacts who have personally taken this medication. Has anyone had any experience with aripiprazole and Autism ADHD Anxiety? Has it been helpful? Was it worth the risk?","New aspie diagnosis , having overstimulated episodes daily from anxiety . always get bad side effect from meds .

"My depression started in middle school, and hit an all- time low in high school. It was hard for me to make friends because I'm so sad all the time, and I feel like a big reason I'm sad is because I don't have friends. One of those catch- 22 situations. I planned to kill myself when I moved away for boarding school my freshman year. My dark poetry wasn't enough of a release anymore, and the few friends I had were growing tired of the sad fog that followed me everywhere. I only ever wanted to talk about myself, and my problems, and EVERYTHING was a problem. As I cried on the phone to my best friend, proclaiming suicide for the millionth time, something snapped in him. He said, ""You're so fucking selfish. The only thing you'd be leaving behind is a mess for the people who love you to clean up.""I didn't speak to him for two weeks, but that moment was my rock bottom, and I rebounded upward. It's like he flipped a switch, and I stopped contemplating hurting myself. Until now. That was almost ten years ago, and I've been riding on the waves of happiness since.

I don't have any free time, and when I have free time, I don't have money. I used to feel tired, but always got myself out of bed in the morning, and to work on time. Now, it seems I can't even do that. It feels like time is slipping between my fingertips, and I'm in this emotionless limbo. I can't hide my negative emotions. I went to dinner with my BF and his mother last night, and I was rude and unpleasant to be around, but I couldn't stop it. I don't even look forward to seeing my BF anymore, and I wish I could just go home to be alone, and cry under the covers. But when I get there, I feel lonely.

I've written some horrible things to remind me of who I am on myself today because I deserve to remember. I just want to ask is it possible to become a truly good person when everytime you seem to be doing that you always relapse out of the light and back into a vile moment?

"So the ADHD that I think I have if not ADHD, then it's gotta be something else brain- related, as I've been suspected to be autistic before for example is kind of ruining my life, from throwaway hobbies, to underperforming at school, to ruining my relationships with people around me. I told my parents and they've agreed to book an appointment for me with a GP, but I'm not sure what to say. My thoughts are always so convoluted and unclear that I'm worried that I'll just come across as either a faker, a stupid person, or someone who shouldn't be taken seriously as they can't even explain their problems well. 1 How do I exactly tell the GP about my symptoms? Do I just list them? Do I go super into detail about how my problems have affected my life? Do I even mention the word ""ADHD""? 2 How do I not come across as a drug- seeker? I know even my mom thinks I am one, as she asked me whether I was just saying this now because some of my friends are on meds and I want an easier time with life. Which, by the way is not true as my friends being on meds has only served to show me how much I truly probably need help, and I personally want an ANSWER to why I am the way I am. 3 This may sound stupid, but do I mention my coping self- medication habits? I feel like I shouldn't because some of them are really unhealthy, like drinking lots of caffeine to make 9 of the wandering thoughts in my head shut up so that the 1 useful one can actually be used",Going to a doctor soon - ish .

"Take this with a grain of salt, because it's only been working for me consistently during quarantine, since can do what I want at my own pace all day instead of having those few hours allocated.

"Howdy, Just like many, many people I suffer anxiety. It breaks me out in a sweat to hear my phone ring. If I have to go to a parent teacher meeting, I just KNOW I'm going to make an idiot out of myself. There are many days I don't check the mail. I don't make friends because I avoid people. I usually want to go to a family function- but just can't cope, I get too uncomfortable. Even the word ""anxiety""makes me nervous. On top the friggin' point. I have recently been in the hospital for respiratory issues. The pulmonary doctor recommended I get a pulse oxygen reader. The little plasticy- science bit they put your finger when you go in the hospital. Upon returning home, I can say that it did not only help with breathing it has kept me aware of my heart rate. When I felt myself getting really nervous, I sat with the pulse- ox on until I watched my heart rate slowly go down. It gave me a focus and science before becoming overwhelmed. Watching the little heart rate, I could breathe slower and relax. pulse- ox ",A Pulse Oximeter is helping me a lot with anxiety .

"Evident by the fact I made a separate Reddit account for this post, I am deeply embarrassed by my compulsions. A bit of backstory, since the start of my OCD about a year or two ago, my room has been a sort of sanctuary for me in terms of cleanliness. Eg. After school or after the gym, I can shower and know I'm clean in my room, whether I'm at my computer or on my bed. May I also add that unlike a lot of cases of OCD I've seen, I have little to no problem with germs, I'm well educated about the minimal amount of sanitation needed to prevent harmful infection. My problem is solely with being dry, and non- sticky. So if I crack open a can of Coke for example and get a bit on my hand as I open it, I have to wash my hands, with soap aswell. So you can imagine I definitely wash my hands everytime I use the bathroom. So where this gets beyond normal even my OCD standards, is the fact that I can't use the toilet clothed. I just have this obsession that I sprinkle urine all over my trousers when I know myself that I don't, but it's the nagging self doubt that tells me I have, the reason that I use the bathroom naked is so that if I think I get some on me I can shower use baby wipes . As you can imagine, my bathroom at home is the only place I can really take off my clothes to just use the bathroom. When I do go out with my friends into the city or on a night out, I may end up using the bathroom for health reasons, when you got to go you got to go. When I get home, I shower and change clothes. From the hand washing, my hands are red raw and no amount of moisturiser which I rarely use because of the whole dry non- sticky thing can fix. This whole thing is embarrassing for me and heartbreaking for myself and my parents who share my grief and don't understand the crippling anxiety it gives me",I have cleanliness issues that makes it so I feel that I get urine on my clothes when I go to the toilet when it is really the obsessive self doubt telling me that I am .,"I can't use the bathroom naked because I'm afraid I 'll get germs on my hands, so I have to wash my hands everytime I use it, and I ca nt use the toilet clothed.

"Hey fellow redditors, I just made a new reddit account specifically to come on this sub For the sake of anonymity and was hoping to get some help on my situation. I already searched tons of resources on google and stuff but each case is always different in subtle ways, and I'd like to hear some more personal stories, both perspectives, people with loved ones and people with BPD, instead of the usual psychological guides and stuff. Sorry in advance for the looong post. So long story short, I went out with a gf with traits of BPD Undiagnosed tho for a year. It's been already half a year that we're broken up, but we had the usual cycles of talking again, meeting up, getting on to something and then a ""crash""again, for us to not talk for a while and re begin. This happened 2 times. According to my current understanding of Borderline Personality Disorder, she idolized me at the beginning, and due to problems with codependency and personal stuff, she ended up kind of ""rejecting""me You know, the black and white thinking stuff . We still talk, and I try to be as open as possible about my feelings, reassuring that I love her etc. and sometimes ask her what she thinks She claims that I'm really important for her but that she's unable to show affection and she doesn't know if she loves me or not. However, I'd like to note that the ""crashes""were usually caused by me. For example, everything would be going pretty well and then I would express my sadness about not being in a relationship with her, triggering a guilt response and leading to more distance. AFAIK, she deals with a great amount of self guilt, insecurities and the fear of abandonment Which apparently is the main thing among ppl with BPD . Anyway, this thing is starting to eat me from the inside, it really sucks I've made huge efforts, and I believe that the codependency issues are mostly gone for me, now the only problem is that I really, really miss her I know that our relationship is not really healthy, and even though I still have some hope that we can end up together, she refuses therapy and she isn't really headed anywhere. Even if we get back into a relationship one day I don't even know if it'll work out. According to what I read online, BPD doesn't really magically disappear, and requires tons of deep reflections on the person's behalf, something that she's probably not at all ready to do. And their loved ones, like me, usually end up having to sacrifice tons. So I'm thinking maybe this isn't worth it anymore, but there's one thing that I keep clinging onto, and it's the memories. Because a BPD relationship always goes through that phase of intense affection, love, intimacy I felt so good a year ago, everything was so perfect, I had it all I can't let that go, I can't accept the fact that it won't happen again. I keep hoping that we'll get back together and reexperience all this. I do deal with a few insecurities Although I consider myself more or less emotionally stable and so it's hard to imagine a life without the intense affection which I was once granted","I 'm trying to get my exwBPD back but it 's starting to hurt so I 'm thinking of giving up , but I ca n't let go of my memories with her .

"Hi im 17 and new to reddit I made an account after finding this subreddit and seeing how kind and supportive people here are and i guess i wanted to let some stuff out and get some advice maybe? Ok so im a junior in highschool taking all honors AP classes as well as classes at the local community college so I can hopefully get my associates in arts degree along with my high school diploma when I graduate. Last summer I was chosen to go to a ""smart kid camp""for the top smartest 1 in my state. Trust me i'm not trying to brag but, all my life i've been considered a smart kid with a bright future that's going places. My problem is that I can't live up to this ideal anymore and I'm really distressed about it. I've never had a 4.0 GPA, it's usually at least a 3.5 though but since last year my GPA has been around a 2.8. It's cause my head gets cloudy and I get frustrated and confused so much now in class. I can't stand not understanding what's going on and I hate asking for help because I don't want to look like an idiot especially in Calculus . I feel so hopeless. Also I have no motivation to get out of bed or off the computer or to stop watching TV or to stop doing useless stuff to do the homework that'll save my GPA and get me in to a good college. If I can ever start my homework I get overwhelmed about how much latework I have on top of my regular homework that I give up and don't do any of it. I don't know what to do I feel so useless and stupid not doing anything to save my future. I can't schedule, make to do lists, use planners, or organize my life at all. I've tried probably everything by now online printables, asking someone to hold me accountable for what I don't get done, stickie notes, keeping hair ties on my wrist to keep track of what i still need to do and expensive leather bound planners with custom pens. Nothing works or keeps me organized or motivated. I'm constantly missing school events or even club activities that I want to go to but i just never wrote down the date and i just forgot. I hate being like this, it makes me feel unreliable and untrustworthy. I really need to get it together and soon.

It is hard, but I know that it's someone I want to be with so I learn how to understand to be there or not be there the way she needs. So my experience isn't really long term, but knowing I'm with the girl I want to be with makes being strong easier.

"After years of not getting the best grades, and not following through on personal goals I have come to expect and fear failure to follow through on any goal I set for myself. For example, I really want to do ""well""in school next year, and ""well""for me has in the past been defined as getting all A's and maybe a few B's. That has been my gold standard, and after consistently not hitting that mark, I've grown quite cynical when it comes to my own goals. I was wondering if anyone else here on r ADHD has gone through this or something similar. And what did you do about it? What I think After some therapy and serious introspection about why I have begun to expect myself to fail, I realized I can't measure my success failure as a person by my grades. I had a tough year last year, and my therapist I never thought i needed therapy, but I've had one short session and it was great! asked me if I could honestly say I did my best, taking into account all the circumstances. I realized that allthough there are things I could have done better, I still did my best. Despite being half a planet away from home, and in a totally new environment I wanted to do well, I tried to do things right, and I hated that I didn't meet my or others expectations.

"There's this concert I really wanna go to next week. I've asked my friends and none of them want to go with me. I've been going through an increasingly harder time lately dealing with almost constant anxiety and depression, waiting and waiting for appointments that are still coming up, trying to get the proper help for myself. But the waiting is taking a toll. I'm the kind of person that needs to have a bunch of things planned out to be able to look forward to something otherwise I feel like I don't even have a reason to get up some days effin' depression . I can't just sit at home almost every night with no plans, it's making me go crazy. This concert is something I've had in my mind for a while, and I just assumed I would find someone to go with. But now I have no one. SoI'm debating whether I should go alone. Pros it would give me a night out, it is something I've been looking forward to and can still look forward to up until the night comes, and I will really enjoy the music. It sounds like a good idea until my anxious brain starts coming up with thoughts like these - I'm a gigantic loser who doesn't know enough people to find someone to go with I mean c'mon, it's a pop concert! I'm gonna be some creepy weird loner at a concert sitting standing beside all these people who came in groups, feeling self- conscious. - Everyone around me is gonna be looking at me weirdly after they realize I'm there alone since I'm not talking to anyone - Worse, some random probably inebriated extrovert sitting next to me is gonna realize I'm alone and start talking to me trying to befriend me cue social anxiety - I will spend the entire concert feeling uncomfortable, unable to freely dance jump sing along have any fun whatsoever because I have no one there to enjoy the music with - Lastly, I'm a loser, I'm a loser, I'm a loser! I'm probably overreacting but this is giving me major anxiety nonetheless. How can I possibly go and enjoy this by myself? Has anyone done this before? Has anyone done this before and actually lived through it lol? Any 'success' stories tips? Are my trepidations unwarranted?

"So i have had many a panic attack before and lots of anxiety attacks as well. They suck. Its horrible. 0 10 do not recommend. All jokes aside I had a bad one on my way to work this morning. There are probably 100 reasons as to the why but right now that doesnt exactly matter. I tried calming myself down with breathing, with redirecting my thoughts and i was just becoming more panicked thinking i was having a heart attack that is usually what it feels like for me, racing heart, dizziness etc so i decided instead of calling 911 like i have in the past i called my coworker who also has anxiety and told her what was happening and to stay on the phone with me as i was only 2 mins from work. Once i knew i was at work near people i would be okay, even if i was having a real heart attack people would be around and someone could call an ambulance for me.

Make an appointment with one of them. Be prepared to wait a couple months before their first available appointment.

"This isn't the kind of thing people in subs like this want to hear, but I just faced it until I was ""over it""enough to be functional. I still hate talking on the phone, but it's not like in high school where getting called on in class gave me derealization and sweaty shaky palms and dizziness and nausea. Forget class presentations did everything I could to get out of them, or somehow ""hide""myself during them, basically until I was 28 years old. It's been so many years of work though. I sang in a talent show in 8th grade my voice was so shaky, everyone thought my vibrato was on purpose . The applause I got there helped alot and I've been trying to hone my singing skills slowly but surely ever since. I played the lead in my first and only high school play 11th grade . I only tried out because it was shakespeare and everyone else who tried out was just so AWFUL - I was confident I'd do well and show the kids how it was done. Didn't think I'd get the part though - the drama department is always about politics, no way they'd give an outsider like me the lead. I thought I was safe. But I got the part and was even approached by a talent scout afterwards. Thanks, but no thanks lol I gradually stepped out of my comfort zone more and more, and was met with moderate success as I did. That was enough for me to try to step out a TINY bit more. I was still scared of doing anything in front of other people until amp unless I KNEW I was fantastic at it, however. This made meeting new people uncomfortable - unless I thought I could be somehow impressive at something, I thought my existence was worthless. After being picked on for my thick glasses amp buck teeth amp quiet ""teacher's pet""tendencies as a kid someone even spit in my face once , I was convinced I had to be impressive for anyone to ever accept me at all. In the meantime, I was so scared of being judged, I did my best to blend in at all times - I didn't want to be in any way remarkable unless I knew I was REALLY REALLY remarkable. Which I never would be, of course, because last I checked, I'm human. Well, part of stepping out was finding work. So I did - but it took ages because my social anxiety prevented me from following up after applications amp interviews. The turning point would be when I started my podcast. THIS is the approach I really, really recommend. Do a podcast with one friend who'll be in charge of looking at comments amp listener numbers, and have them tell you how the show is doing. Podcasting is great because you're talking to yourself or to friends, that's it. There's no immediate feedback from anyone. With a co- podcaster as intermediary, they can filter the good news out to you a good idea since there are truly mean trolls out there who'll send nasty e- mails and comments . Eventually, the size of our audience - only about 5 or 10 thousand at our peak, but still that's pretty amazing! really hit me, like I internalized it and realized up to 10, 000 people thought of the commentary on this show - which was between 25 and 75 mine on any given episode - as valuable. PEOPLE DID NOT HATE ME. This was a gradual realization, but my life literally changed completely, for the better, once I arrived at it. I did the show over five years, and my public speaking skills have gotten so good that people ask me if I've done toastmasters or taken classes. Class presentations? Psh. No problem, as long as I know what I'm talking about. Gotta ask someone for help on something? Not a problem! I'll ask people who to ask if I don't know! Networking in order to find a starting point on my career path? Done and done, baby. All because podcasting allowed me to gradually face people without even realizing I was doing it. Still have a hard time talking on the phone though. If your pizza place doesn't have online ordering, you're not getting my business. At least until I find some way to work on this one","It 's worth it to try facing the fear gradually . Just be very , very patient . I was a nervous , quiet , nauseous wreck around people before .

"I did this a LOT in my teenage years. I grew up in a difficult home and was bullied at school, so I made up characters to express myself through. I found someone with similar needs to escape to roleplay with, and we wouldnt do anything else. I was consumed by this need to escape everything. When I was not roleplaying I was daydreaming about scenes. No matter what I was doing with whom, I always wanted to escape to my fantasy world instead. I roleplayed while with other non- roleplay friends, and so brought my laptop everywhere. People got pissed and worried, it was not fun at all, and deep inside I knew it was an addiction. Now, 10 years later I still suffer from depression. And I still roleplay and daydream. But there isn't that all consuming need to do so every day. I still get very attached emotionally to my own characters in a way that cannot be healthy their state of mind affects mine and I often compare my characters to characters in tv series, games and books , but I am also able to put it aside and focus on other things as well. I do want to roleplay every day, but I don't NEED to do it, so often weeks and even months passes between sessions. I think it is a fairly normal coping mechanism, in both children and adults. If it does interfer with your relationships, school work and other real life stuff, you should consider getting help for it. But it is not the worst way to handle things, and sometimes we do need our coping mechanisms to get through the day.

"using an alt because this is all pretty personal and i don't want it on my main My childhood friend just told me she wants to die. Her idea is to go by legal euthanasia. She's got a history of unresolved health problems, and anorexia. Both her parents are immigrants she's a citizen and I reckon she's always felt like she didn't fit in. There's a slew of other problems, but it boils down to chronic pain and a subsequent inability to think of the future in any positive way. She's 22, but because of this she stopped her studies a while ago and has only held a job for a few months. Her family environment's pretty toxic as well, her mother's a classic narcissist and her father's an alcoholic who's completely unable to express himself to her without placing blame on her shoulders for not having a job he's Japanese, I guess that may in part explain why work is so important to him . I do think he cares for her though, he just has no idea how to connect with her. Her mum's an ex- model who displaces all her body issues onto her and basically gave her anorexia by proxy when we were kids if that's a thing . The whole euthanasia thing is apparently the idea of another original fuckhead in her life, a ""friend""who's presented the idea of death to her as an escape from pain and the gate to heaven. Or whatever the fuck. I've never met the bloke but I've had fantasies of pushing him off a bridge. So all of this I've more or less known for years and I've tried to help her through it, but the suicidal part is new. I asked her a couple of years back if she wanted to die and she said no. So it's gotten worse since then. She says with her pain levels the way they are she can't contribute to society, so she might as well die. She said a lot of things, I better wrap this up. Now I'm fucking terrified because in the midst of her telling me all this I made a few foolish promises. The stupidest was ""I'm gonna stay"", when she told me I was her only reason for hanging on, I think she said I'm her ""last thread"". Only because I'm a pretty shitty person myself, I can't stay, because moving to different places is my coping method for my own depression. I've lived in 4 different countries in the past 5 years, to give you an idea, and I studied 2 degrees and held 2 temporary jobs living in Europe, guess that's obvious . And also I basically promised her I'd be there for her whenever wherever, but I also can't do that because I'm really people- averse and I have to brave that every time I go to see her. I was just so scared of what she was telling me that I went and swore to do stuff I'm not capable of. I asked her about a dozen times to get counselling.

"Hi! Before I start let me explain myself, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 iirc? and it exactly wasn't noticeable but im 15 now still not on meds btw and it's seriously spiraled out of control due to how impulsive I am. Not beating around the bush here, I think the main issue is that I just don't think before I say anything, and I don't know how to control myself.

"I've been an optimist for most of my life, even to the point where it annoys some people even though most really appreciated it, cause I was always good at cheering others up . However, part of this optimism stems from having excitement and fun all around me. I'm 27 now, and honestly had a very good life. I had a lot of friends, went to a ton of parties and festivals, and once I went to college I went on an exchange program, which was the start of 6 years of living abroad. I moved to three different countries in those years. It was an amazing experience, as I was with plenty of girls and now have a truly amazing girlfriend since 2 years, I saw a lot of the world, I experimented with drugs, I did tons of adrenaline- fuelling things. Long story short since 7 months I live in my home country again Belgium and I really struggled to find a job. This means I'm still living with my parents now, and I'm doing a job I really don't enjoy. My girlfriend is still living on the other side of the world, although she will be moving here in a few months. But all of my old friends here bore the hell out of me. Everybody around me seems so shallow and boring, and all I do is go to a job I hate, go home, play video games and watch series, and go to bed. I barely have social contact, I started to realize how much I dislike the stupidity in people, I'm becoming more introverted by the day and I'm losing interest in everything and everyone, even pushing away the last friends I have here. Now, this is not the first time I have felt this way. The thing is, previously I'd just pack my bags and go to the next country. Run away from the boredom, if you will, because people just bore me so quickly.

"I've dealt with anxiety and depression off and on my whole life. I ended up on Lexapro due to anxiety over some health issues that were freaking me out it turned out to be undiagnosed food allergy and was on it for 3 or 4 years. At the beginning of last year I took 2 months gradually getting off of lexapro. It felt great to not be on it. I had an easier time concentrating and remembering, etc. Everything was fine, until late summer. About 4 months after going off of lexapro, I started getting depressed. I tried Fish Oil, vitamins, thinking positive, etc. None of it worked. By October I was crying uncontrollably every day. I couldn't control my emotions at all and was starting to think about suicide every day. If I hadn't had kids, I would have done it too, there's no question in my mind. I set up an appointment with my psychiatrist and got back on lexapro and welbutrin. It was a HUGE and quick improvement. I might end up on meds for my entire life, but I never would want to revisit this last fall. I've never felt any where close to that bad before","Watch yourself .

"i have been seeing an early intervention service for my psychosis for three weeks now. last appointment, i expressed that i was in a crisis and i needed help. i asked if my social worker could book me into an appointment with a psychiatric nurse at the hospital so i could have an assessment to see if i needed further support. i told her many times i was worried i was going to kill myself this week. she said she didnt think i was that bad, and asked me if i had suicidal intent and i said yes, which i had also literally stated as i walked into the appointment. she said she didnt think it was necessary, and said i should take myself to A ampE if i get worse. im hurt that ive expressed many times that i am experiencing psychotic symptoms and that i am a risk to myself and others but i am still not considered high risk. i dont think theyll take me seriously until i kill myself or take myself to A ampE. i have a few questions about this as i am 15 im aware at 16 i have more rights about being an inpatient , it is very hard to be taken seriously. im currently being told that i dont have psychosis, because it is more long- term than short episodes so they think its something else. - would going to A ampE speed up the process of being checked out by a psychiatric nurse? the early intervention service are withholding information about me and wont diagnose me properly which means i cant access the help i need and i just want to get assessed as soon as possible. ive already been diagnosed with bipolar and i guess psychosis but nothing is being done. - is it better to go to hospital my GP to ask about an assessment with a psychiatric nurse? CAMHS wont see me as they have put me into the EIP service who arent helping - how can i clearly express that i want to be checked into a psychiatric ward as an inpatient? i keep asking about it because i genuinely believe im going to kill myself, but they wont listen when i say that taking myself to A ampE would cause a lot more issues for my family and i need someone else to assess me first - how can i be assertive and get the most out of the service? - how can i initiate being assessed by a psychiatric nurse? - how can i make them take my concerns for myself being high risk seriously? i really want to be checked in as an inpatient but honestly i dont think theyll take me seriously until i attempt to kill myself and show up. which i evidently am trying to avoid. i just want help",i want to be checked into hospital so i do nt kill myself but the NHS wo nt take my concerns seriously and i m not in a place to pursue it because i am very much at risk of killing myself . i have a few questions above about expressing myself clearly and asserting how to get help . any help or advice from people who have any experience would be so greatly appreciated .,i want to be checked into a psychiatric ward as an inpatient but i do nt think they ll take me seriously until i attempt to kill myself or take myself to A ampE. how can i be assertive and get the most out of the service?,i want to be assessed as an inpatient but i do nt think they ll take me seriously until i attempt to kill myself or take myself to A ampE. how can i make them take my concerns for myself being high risk seriously?,i want to be assessed by a psychiatric nurse but i do nt think they ll take me seriously until i attempt to kill myself or take myself to A ampE. how can i be assertive and get the most out of the service?,0.48333333333333334,0.13559322033898305,0.3,0.4273504273504274,0.13913043478260867,0.2735042735042735,0.4615384615384615,0.10434782608695652,0.2735042735042735

"The meds effects are subjective and tend to have non neglectable side effects. The meds are not magic they don't cure ADHD and quite frankly they tend reduce your lifespan on average due to the increase in blood pressure and overall cardiac activity, they are just a tool that you can use if your life is chaos or if you have an objective. Most of us can't afford to get the proper long term therapy that is required so we turn to the meds. As you noted meds are also better if you have a proper professional who understands and help you figure out the right dosage but for some people that process is lengthy and therefore can be expensive.

"I check this sub every now and again because I believe it has helped be get to the point where I am thirty- three days clean. However, i just suddenly realized how bad I want to cut. I went to prom on Saturday and I spent thirty minutes crying the bathroom because I had to see my ex and the guy she cheated on me with together. I still love her and it was very painful to see. I believe that I am a weak person because of how much seeing her with this guy affected me. Other than the first hour, and something I will mention later, I really enjoyed prom. I got to slow dance with my ex twice, which was nice. I asked her about why we danced in a way that was definitely not a friend dance, and all she said was that she was trying to show me kindness. This idea kinda hurt, but it allowed me to finally get over her. I now know that there is no possible way to be with her. I may hit her up when she finally breaks it off with this guy though. I really love her. I have Tourette's Syndrome. TS is characterized by having multiple motor and vocal tics. Sometimes these tics will manifest as complex impulses instead of simple gesture impulses. I have a motor tic that causes me to bash my head on anything around me and one that causes me to hit myself in the head with a closed fist. On the bus ride to where after- prom was going to be held, i had a ticcing episode that lasted 15 minutes and left me with a probable concussion. However, this was not the worst of it. Three hours after the previous event, I had another tic episode, but this time it lasted 45 minutes. During this episode I roamed the halls of the YMCA and sat down and tucked my head between my legs every time I felt a tic episode occurring. When I thought it was over, I began walking to where my friends were. On the way over there, I had a leg tic that made me throw my leg behind me and caused me to trip. I slammed my knee on the ground and spent the next 30 minutes on the ground ticcing, convulsing and crying. I broke my glasses in the process and had several violent tics resulting in a bruised hip, elbows, and forehead, and a concussion that has caused me significant pain since then. I don't know why I started crying. It started as a vocal tic with my taking a fast intake of breath and resulted in my crying for the next 7 minutes. I couldn't stop for the life of me. All of this happened in the middle of the YMCA for all of the staff, my teachers, and junior and senior class to see. I am so incredibly embarrassed. My friends tell me not to and that I couldn't help it and that they understand, but I have felt a need to repeatedly apologize to them for ruining their night. The event resulted in my dad being called and me having to ride home with the principal. Thoughts of this have not left my head. I can't forget it. I just want something to distract me. I KNOW it will help. What I don't know if it is worth it. What if my ex wants to get back together with me, but stops because she knew I cut? That would destroy me. I know any way you look at it, all what I have for her is young love, but that doesn't change how deeply I feel for her. She is the person responsible for my current streak of 33 days clean from cutting. She helps me through every episode of severe depression that I have and other than that one mistake she made, she is a great person. She may not be the best person to be in an intimate relationship with, but she is a phenomenal friend. That said, all I long for is for the sweet release that I know cutting will give me.

"I have suffered with SAD every fall winter for the past 6 years now. Since it began back in high school and I didnt really know anything about how to cope with it, I didnt use medication in the beginning. The first few years, I tried writing down my thoughts and struggles since nobody in my friend group had been through anything like SAD. I didnt talk to our high school counselor because she was honestly a joke and ridiculed the kids at our school. I was living in a very small town so there wasnt any additional resources for therapy. These circumstances resulted in me spending every November- March in my room. Since it started, it has been getting worse every year. My freshman year of college I tried taking vitamin D supplements and saw no improvement. My sophomore year of college I tried vitamin D and B12 supplements, yoga, and meditation. Still, none of these seemed to make things better. I was discouraged and felt defeated. This year I finally decided to see a doctor about getting on some kind of anti- depressant. I had done some research about which medications I didnt want to take and which I would be interested in trying. The doc prescribed me 150ml of Wellbutrin and I opted for the same dosage of the generic college student budget ya know Bupropion XL. He warned me that this medication would take up to 4 weeks to fully take affect, but after 2 weeks of taking this medication I felt ZERO improvement. When we had our 2 week follow- up, he decided to go ahead and up my dosage to 300ml. I have been on that dosage since mid December. I felt some slight improvement through the holidays and early days of January, but now I feel as though Im back at square one. Im not sure what I should do. It may be important to note that I am in a fast- paced, ruthlessly unorganized internship at a large company. I have been working there for a year now. I work full days on MWF and go to class on TR. The reason I stick around is because they pay well and there is a likelihood that they will hire me on full- time when I graduate in December. Its incredibly stressful and my boss is cold as a robot, but its in my desired field. I have a wonderful relationship, family, and friends. Nothing to complain about in that aspect, but yet my depression seeps through anyway. Saturated, thick, and darker every year. Any advice is appreciated","I have had SAD for 6 years .

"It was hardwired in through out ancestors. Our evolutionary ancestors. I'm talking about reptiles. Or more specifically the ancient ancestor that we humans and all reptiles share in common. Those species developed brain geography that we still have today. Today's reptiles never got any of the expansion brain slots. We got them all. But we still have the same fight or flight card, among others. So then maybe your question is, why didn't humans evolve away from having anxiety. Well, because it's actually quite useful to have anxiety responses in many dangerous situations. We still experience potentially dangerous situations regularly. So then maybe your question is, why do we get anxious when there is no actual danger. That's actually because of all those extra brain cards we have. With so much going on up there, it's quite easy for things to get crossed, and short circuited. It would seem natural that being able to experience anxiety around social situations could be advantageous in many circumstances. We are social animals. But civilization has brought a level of social that is very complex even for our gargantuan brains. We strive to understand how to function in a complex world, and sometimes we accidentally tap into that reptilian fear zone. Connections are strengthened in the brain to the fight or flight response through learning easily enough. I suppose the genes play a role in the sizes of certain brain structures and the connections between different areas of the brain too. Anyway, if we were a dumb reptile, or even a relatively smart dog, we wouldn't be faced with all of these opportunities to learn to have anxious responses to all this weird stuff. We'd still have the fight or flight response. There's just not as many things that can trip the false alarm. Being anything other than human is a comparatively simple existence. But still, animals learn to fear things that aren't dangerous too. They just can't tell us all about it because they don't even have language. But all animals, at least as evolved as reptiles, experience anxiety. There are so few reasons for a lizard to learn to have anxiety instead of only experiencing fear when it's needed. We have the fear response of a lizard. But a huge brain wrapped around it trying to tell it what to do. Things don't always work right. Anxiety is born. ","Anxiety is the fear response gone awry . The fear response was a part of brains long before humans . It keeps us alive by telling us to dodge out of the way of a train , and stuff . There always has and always will be a need for having fear .","It's actually quite useful to have anxiety when there is no actual danger, but it's also useful to experience anxiety in dangerous situations.

"I've been pursuing animation ever since childhood. Drawing was always a passion of mine and since I was extremely shy growing up, some of my fondest childhood memories are watching Saturday morning cartoons at home. Music and sculpting are some hobbies that I picked up later in life, but I've always been very focused on being an animator for a living. As to what made me lose motivation, it's probably a combination of several things. Adult life in general has been a swift kick in the nads and I did get to work as an animator for a couple of years, but for lackluster studios. Places where management was more interested in cutting corners to meet ridiculously impossible deadlines, and in copying already popular media instead of letting the artists create something new and original. I know there are studios out there that aren't like this, but I don't feel like I'm good enough to work for one of those yet. And a few years ago I decided to move to a different city and I left one of my studio jobs behind. It's been close to 3 years now and I'm still getting by working day jobs, I can't seem to get anything in my field anymore. That's been slowly killing my self esteem and my confidence as an animator, so I've been doing less and less art to the point where I barely even pick up the pencil or open Photoshop anymore.

"the problem is that you have to actually put effort into understanding the choices of medication so you can choose which one you prefer and most of the time even if not immediately the psych will be fine with your suggestion. See, the problem with antidepressants is that a good bunch of them are just SSRI's and SNRI's. Much fewer but other ones are various different ones often the only ones in their class. So if serotonin is not the problem and SSRI doesnt work because its just not what you need, the point of jumping from one SSRi to other is zero. Of course you will keep jumping from one ssri to other, then to SNRI's, but i will oversimplify this and say youre jumping on the same medication over and over with different secondary effects. If you dont say nothing, most psychs will want you to try another SSRI after the first, then a third. That's because for a lot of people, their depression is mild to moderate, not severe, and dont require much more. Of course one SSRI can work perfectly while other one not, that is because the ssri's all have varying selectivity for one group of serotonin receptors over others and different metabolites. However if the 3rd ssri doesnt work at all, then you have to ask, saying you dont think SSRI is what you need, that you want anything else. If an ssri somewhat works, then its a matter of finding a combo that mitigates the negatives. there's atypical antidepressants, that are not SSRI's like bupropion stimulant , mirtazapine serotonergic and noradrenergic . Now each alone these are not very effective for most but a good combo will synergize. Bupropion gives Norepinephrine and very little dopamine. Mirtazapine gives a lot of serotonin and norepinephrine and very little dopamine as its 5HT2C antagonist . Now these together potentiate each others dopaminergic effect, and instead of taking just a sedating mirtazapine - the bupropion negates the sedation and weight gain, while mirtazapine negates the stimulation anxiety and sleepiness. Instead of just Norephinephrine or just serotonin you get A lot of norephinephrine, less but a lot serotonin and little dopamine. These three will be effective much more than each alone, and just because one or the other didnt help you enough doesnt mean the combo is the same at all. there is zoloft and prozac which have veryy mild dopaminergic effect instead of being just SSRI. prozac has 5HT2C antagonism like mirtazapine, now inhibiting the 5HT2C increases dopamine and norepinephrine because this receptor suppresses these two neurotransmitters. taking prozac and mirtazapine will inhibit this receptor significantly resulting in at least some dopamine on top of sserotonin instead of just pure serotonin. This is important because a lot of ssri's are not only antidopaminergic because increasing serotonin indirectly results in less dopamine and vice verse, also many ssri's have antidopaminergic effects by either blocking dopamine receptors, or activating the specific serotonin receptors that inhibit dopamine like the 5ht2c again . So at least some dopamine will negate the not only weight gain but libido loss from SSRI's. bupropion as is mildly dopaminergic will increase libido completely opposite to SSRI's. It can be combined with any ssri to negate the negatives of that certain ssri. prozac bupropion, bupropion mirtazapine or bupropion mirtazapine prozac is a safe combo, as youre not combining SSRIs. mirtazapine can be changed with agomelatine as a less sedating alternative. bupropion and mirtazapine can be added to pretty much all SSRI's i think. tianeptine is very effective for anxious depression and panic disorder, if youre from EU. amp after SSRI's, come SNRI's now instead of serotonin they also give norephinephrine, but this difference is too little to make much difference from just ssri's and while its not ssri class, its his blood brother. TCA's are old school SNRIs that are too sedating usually, but together with bupropion it could be a very viable choice. Swap any ssri with tca. amp sadly we dont have directly dopaminergic antidepressants except for the very mild dopaminergic effect from bupropion NDRI , but as i said bupropion requires some help to unlock its dopaminergic potential synergy. MAOIs' are old school but most of the time much more effective than ssri's, snris and others. There was a lot of mistaken info about MAOIs in the 2000s, making a lot of docs be too afraid to prescribe them, and only now the studies coming out show the absurd and wrong results of past studies on MAOIs safety. Even as obvious as lumping MAOIs and SSRIs into one, thats where the confusion about ecstasy and ssri safety comes. SSRI's not only are safe but neuroprotective because they occupy the same pathway that ecstasy MDMA uses, and anyone who has tried ecstasy on SSRIs know that ecstasy is blocked from working so the danger was about MAOIs and ecstasy. There was also exaggerated danger of food interactions with MAOIs, but even though the still available and used MAOIs are very selective and safe, MAO- B inhiitors are pretty safe without adjusting diet much , MAOIs to this day are avoided at all costs and given as last resort, after even trying antipsychotics and all kind of bullshit that is even more dangerous, before trying MAOI, even tho its more effective than SSRIs and SNRIs and TCA's. MAO- A inhibitors increase serotonin, MAO- B inhiitors increase serotonin and norepinephrine. Reversible MAOIs are safe even with the tyramine cheese interaction chance","got tired of trying new SSRis , snris and TCAs , decided to learn about antidepressants available and how they work , found the one that I think should help and it did . Tianeptine , bupropion also rasagiline MAOI - B was perfect and i had the option of trying various combinations with these two as the base core . the dopaminergic and antianxiety effect of tianeptine , the stimulation and noradrenergic efffect from bupropion plus fluoxetine for the serotonin . This was my best combo and this way i got the trio of all main neurotransmitters in mood - serotonin , norephinephrine , dopamine . Bupropion plus made me quit smoking . PM me if you wanna ask something","SSRI's are norepinephrine and serotonin, SNRI''s give norephinephrine and dopamine, and bupropion and mirtazapine are dopamine receptors that inhibit the 5HT2C, which in turn increases the dopamine and serotonin in the body, and thus negates the negative side effects of SSRI's. SSRIs can be combined with other drugs to negate the negative effects of the SSRI, but it's a matter of finding a combo that mitigates the negatives of that SSRI.","SSRI's are nt the same as SNRIs, they re not the same in that they have different effects on the neurotransmitters that affect the neurotransmitter responsible for depression and panic disorder. They re not a replacement for SSRIs because they have fewer side effects, but they do have a lot of the same effects.","There are many ssri's that are just SSRI's, but most of them have a different effect on the neurotransmitters dopamine and noradrenergic.

There's also atypical antidepressants that are not just SSRIs like bupropion, mirtazapine, and prozac. They work by potentiating the effects of a ssri to negate the negative effects of that ssri. They can be combined with other meds to make a very safe and effective combination, as long as they do nt antagonize the same 5HT1C receptors as the SSRI.",0.3516483516483516,0.022222222222222227,0.1978021978021978,0.19753086419753085,0.0,0.13580246913580246,0.2481203007518797,0.04545454545454546,0.13533834586466165

She wouldn't give me affection unless it was a show for someone else, called me her niece in public for a while, drank all the time, and made her adult problems mine. I had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent. When I was 13 or so I remember she spit on me. When I was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because I started calling my step mom ""mom""too. I never called her by her name to her face, she just didnt want to share. Following 16, she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention, which I always treated seriously. Our relationship was so weird. First she didnt want me, then we were familiar strangers, acquaintances, distant cousins, and then friends. Until her last suicide attempt, that accidentally went through. The table broke under her. The police I called called me to come down.

"SORRY THIS IS LONG Ok this was a little hard for me to write, but I thought that admitting my faults would help me understand the real issue here. Ok let me first give some background, I'm in my second last year of high school and have no real friends, I used to be part of the 'popular mean guys sport prodigy' group somehow absolutely no idea how this happened but when they started doing drugs and drinking I stopped going out with them and eventually stoped talking to them. But in school I still hang out with them but I barely talk to any of them. During this I pretended that my phone was broken so I couldn't contact them, too this day I still pretend I don't have a phone even though my parents have got my a pretty expensive phone. I just can't bring myself to tell anyone I have a phone because that will force me too talk to people outside of school. I haven't been outside of my home since in the last 1.5years except for school, family events or getting a haircut. when I get a haircuts I go out of my way to go to a hairdresser that no one I could possible know would be I also live within walking distance of school so I don't hang out with people after school. The one thing that I'm good at is that I don't have any anxiety when I'm talking to anyone like none but the issue I have is that I can't make conversations flow, I just seem to run out of things to talk about as I have no hobbies or anything eventful in my life any just end up talking about school with everyone, like a broken record. I now have a text document with everybody I talk to that day which I try to brainstorm things to talk about. So right now I'm trying to find a way to change groups but I just don't know how to, people just group me in with the ""sporty party guys""and with my lack of conversation skills I just can't make a break through , when I do have a solid conversation I'm just forgotten the next day.

"Iv been test trialing adderall 30mg XR as a medication to treat my ADD ADHD- PI and so far it works wonders for minimizing my symptoms but one particular has been the one and only symptom I cant shake and cope with. As everyone else does, when i first take the pill I feel the short euphoric period, which i understand now is temporary but after that my mood doesn't return to normal or to anything for that matter. I just feel empty and I dont really care much or things. It seems like everything just has no meaning and nothing is worth while doing like with doing things I love doing. Whenever i take my meds i never take my earphones to listen to music on the way to class and for me that very odd. Its like pointless to listen to music because I feel zero emotion. Same with my favorite tv show or working out, everything just seems pointless because I cant feel happy or hopeful or ANYTHING from it it seems like nothing in the world will excite me or just put me in a good mood. Usually when im not on meds and im anticipating something exciting or fun or relaxing later that day, I get a quick rush of stimulation from that thought. Is like when I do this on meds it not nearly the same. Its almost as if I can feel the quick second of numbness when I try to think of something that will make me happy. Sort of like when your skin is numb you cant feel anything and you dont notice it but when you touch it, you can feel your skin resisting the sensation of you finger touching it. I know to some are not bothered by this but for me this is the worst side effect of aderall. This is sort of ironic to becuase to me the worst symptom or hardest cope with is the emotional instability that comes with adhd. I hate the moods swing and the emotional sensitivity. Anyways, this side effect honestly makes me not want to take meds at all because It sort feels like depression. I was diagnosed with mild depression this past winter mostly from my adhd diagnoses seeing that its the cause for a lot failiers and problems in highschool. I sort of got over that eventually but still felt a sort of a subtle depressive sadness for a few months and thought i was still depressed. I am now realizing that that might have been still is the meds just taking away my ability to be happy. I cant remember the last time I was just in a great mood, appreciative and happy with life and friend other than adderall euphoria for 30 min. Anyone got any ideas on why this might be happening and even how I can fix it. I have seen threads on the ""emotionless zombie""effect but not described the way im feeling it. I have been on and off the meds and I sometimes try to empty half the capsule to get a smaller dose but I still sort of feel that same ""everything is pointless""feeling. Yes, I do plan on speaking to my doctor about this but thats not for 2 weeks since im still at school and i want to do it face to face but he's not really an adhd specialist so i feel he wont help much","Adderall makes everything in life seem pointless and sucks the enjoyment out of almost anything that makes me happy .

"Oo ok. I'd say Freelance has obvious benefits - setting your own schedule, being able to set up your workspace exactly how you want to, choose which assignments you accept, how much vacation you want to take, etc. Big drawback is the structure routine is 100 on you.

"This is a throwaway account and I apologize for the length in advance. TLDR at the bottom . To whomever does read this thank you! Growing up, I was blessed with a loving tight- knit family. My mom was amazing, fun, compassionate, outgoing, and everyone who knew her loved her. She has the true heart of a servant and was very involved in programs at our school and church. It all started the summer before high school. My mom was a dietitian who took a job at a mental hospital. Slowly, her personality began to change, she started crying all the time and making odd comments. It had to be the stress, right? Within a year, my dad took a new job and moved our family back to the state I grew up in. We all thought everything would slowly go back to normal, except it didnt. Everything got even weirder. The first instance I remember vividly, we were driving home from school and my mom covered up the light sensor on her rearview mirror. She said that they were watching her. My brother and I were both puzzled, who was she talking about? Throughout my freshman year of high school, she would often mishear the radio or the tv thinking they were talking about her. She had her good days and bad days. We started looking for a church. my family was always very involved in our church growing up She would often leave the service and go to the car until it was over stating they were talking about her during the sermon. Over time, things kept getting worse. One day, she took apart the ceiling fan as they were spraying chemicals on her. Another day, she got rid of the smoke detectors as they were spying on her. Another day, she took apart her box spring as they were making her bed shake. We tried to get her help over and over, but she refused. She thinks everyone in her life is lying to her and is out to get her. We talked to her doctor, lawyers, NAMI desperate for a way to help her. However, she is always very adamant that the issue was NOT with her, it was the stalkers. Legally, we cant do anything until she dangers herself or someone else. She wont talk to any medical professional about these attacks for fear of them saying she has mental illness lies. She is very protective of her medical charts and to this day I am not sure if an official diagnosis has ever been made. I just want to help her, but Im not sure how to help her get back in touch with reality. Eventually, my dad left and my mom lives on her own and holds down a job. She barely sleeps and is constantly terrified. Now, it has been 11 years since this all began. She is worse than ever. She no longer needs background noise to hear things and cant really hold a normal conversation. Her social ques are way off and the delusions have turned sexual sometimes. She believes she is assaulted by this vibrator, stalker, 24 7. She cries on a regular basis that she cant shower or get dressed without being harassed and watched. She often hears people in public talking about how much greater my stepmom is or how terrible she is. I receive many texts per day begging for me to make them stop. I kills me that I cant. She often thinks my brother and I are lying to protect someone and we know what is actually going on or who is behind it. Shell say things like you were too young to know better, but cant you just tell me the truth now. Im not sure what to say to support her anymore. I love my mom and hate seeing her suffer.

"Last year, I was diagnosed with depression after visiting three different doctors about my anxiety attacks during my final examination in high- school. I think it comes down to how my parents kept moving and I kept losing my friends. I kept myself busy with a lot of hobbies but I gradually felt lonely over the years as the energy drinks destroyed my nerves and my anxiety started. Id consume a lot of sugar and caffeine everyday, ate very little, and filled up on noodles over the course of 6- 7 years up until last year. I did this mostly because it was gratifying, it seemed to kill my boredom and at the time I did not suffer any consequences I even believed I was immune to them . This all changed due to the attacks last year when I lit my brain on fire. I started working out, drinking milk, quit caffeinated products, etc. During this time though, no matter how lonesome I was, I never even dreamed of suicide, it seemed like a bizarre and terrifying thing to do especially when its heavily forbidden in my religion Islam . Also because I had a lot to lose, I would never see an Anime, never touch a game, never watch a TV show, etc. However, over time, I would lose interest of all the TV cliches and just look for something that stands out. I would also find out about darwinism and how my religion isnt the one truth. How Ive almost been brainwashed all these years. Although a part of me still believes in theism and I remain conflicted to this day. I got sick of my family quickly and my friends are all just indoors people, the only way I could talk to them was via social media. And this did not help me I wanted to hang out IRL, but most of the time I did not have an excuse to arrange a gathering, and end up alone facing my computer. If I had a crush, I would not pursue it, I somehow felt it was beyond me, or I was above having partners as I had neither the tolerance nor shared interests. Eventually, I would just end up so lonesome that I could literally cry. After getting the proper medications, I would feel a lot better as I made some more friends and warmed up to more people but, alas, here I am, realising that nothing has really changed, Im still alone, and whats worse, 6 months after graduation I still havent found the right college. Not knowing my futures handled and quickly exhausting all of my interests with all the free time I have. Eventually, I feel as though I have nothing to lose, my attachment to my pc, my xbox, my Playstation and my music is fading as I realise I can just as easily live without them. All the things I have yet to see or possess I always wanted a dog but muslims dont allow them , I feel as if it isnt really important as Ive never experienced it before- Ill never know if it is important","At a certain point , you just feel content to let go , just yourself and nothing material .

I've had shit luck with doctors over the last 10 years and after struggling for the past 6 months I've decided to seek out a new doctor for my depression.

But personally, it did a damage on my morale. I thought I was at least decent at my job and now I feel threatened that if I don't live up to their ideals, they'll fire me. I was scared. I spent the rest of the night closing shift , in a state of panic sweaty palms, racing heart, tight chest, etc. Then they tell me that one of my co- workers will be at lunch and I'll be the only one in customer service, and suddenly I feel more pressure from them to take their adviceit was like a test. Once I left, I spent the night sleepless and unable to distract myself from work. Even now, the morning after, I'm still twitchy and uncomfortable. I need some advice.

"I totally get what you mean, and I think the divide is rational for a few reasons. The process of recovering from starvation, no matter what weight you believe in, is completely wild and different than how a non- starved person would manage their weight anorexia vs BED I think, Im not an expert in any way about BED . The Minnesota starvation study showed that your body post starvation will regulate your appetite extreme hunger and body weight overshoot almost automatically. Therefore there is no need for most people recovering from starvation to think about calories mid- recovery, whether theyre on a meal plan or not. I say post starvation not post underweight because even though I did MinnieMaud starting only a few pounds underweight I still restored to a healthy weight, also albeit being technically overweight before I ever dieted But what about post- recovery? Do former anorexics OSFED bulimics need to care about calories then after their weight is restored and extreme hunger abates? I would say no. As the Minnesota starvation study also demostrated, people stopped gaining weight even given free reign over what they ate. Their appetites cool down naturally furthermore, some studies I can try to find it for you show that people who recovered from restrictive eating disorders maintain their body weights at higher calorie intakes than most people. For me, after eating whatever I wanted during recovery, sometimes up to 10, 000 cal per day, I have maintained my healthy weight eating 2500 calories a day give or take as a 54 sedentary woman. I give you my statistics because I am not ordinary. You can find many post anorexics who eat even more food than I do, and many who eat less","The recovery world is not different from the real world . It only seems so because people in recovery and post recovery have different bodies and needs than people who are not recovering from restrictive eating disorders . The key thing to take away is that for most people after recovery , your body will regulate its appetite normally ! This is nt fatlogic hate that term or pseudoscience , it s facts derived from reputable experiments and can be supported by many , many people in the recovery community .","I do nt think there is a difference between anorexia and BED, but I do think it s important to remember that recovering from starvation is a very different process than recovering from BED.","I do nt think it s necessary to think about calories mid - recovery, as long as they re not in excess. I m not an expert, but I think the Minnesota starvation study shows that extreme hunger and body weight overshoot almost immediately after recovery, regardless of whether they re on a meal plan or not.","I think the divide is rational for two reasons 1.

"While it's not a bad idea to allow a few weeks for the change in medication to see if it will take effect, I would still seek out a psychiatrist. My PCP only knew that upping a dose may help, but didn't fully understand depression, or which medications worked best besides the ones he was told to prescribe by sales reps from various anti- depression pill makers.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons. They say self awareness is the first step to beating these things and I've been feeling pretty shit for a loooong ass time now and want to get over it. I'm 21M at uni at the moment, under a lot of pressure to do well from family and friends and also I feel a relationship standpoint. My brother and sister both graduated with a first and being the youngest I've always had to meet or do better than them. So far all my life I've managed to do better than them in pretty much everything but I don't know now, I'm doing a bloody hard degree filled with complex maths and mechanics and engineering and I only got a low B at GCSE English curriculum . So that's that part, onto the next. I'm pretty lazy, I tend to put in the bare minimum to get by in what I do, I don't like what I do advice from me, don't follow your hobby as your career - you'll get sick of it and cease to get joy out of the prospect of the future and regret doing it. I had a job as a waiter a while back because I had too, my brother worked there and so I had to work there, my sister ofcourse didn't need to as she was a girl. I hated it, the boss was an absolute prick and a pervert but I couldn't leave because there was nothing else to do in my town which was Frickin tiny . Other than the work part I don't have motivation to do anything . I stay in bed until my legs hurt and often go without eating. I have no desire to eat and usually go without meals. I don't weigh a lot 5'11""and 8st 1lb, or 51kg . I'm not fit at all, I can barely run 10m before running out of energy. I have no desire or want to do anything. Most of my meals are things I can make in 2 minutes, but I don't have any money being a student to spend on take out and ready meals so today I've had 2 bowls of microwave porridge And that's it. I don't want to go outside, I don't really have any friends. I work when I need to to meet deadlines. My day is usually thus wake up 10- 1, stay in bed til 4, at some point remember to eat and drink. Watch YouTube videos as they're the only things that interest me these days, get out of bed because my legs ache, sit at computer and play games to take my attention away from life. I have a girlfriend and I love her so so much, but I have so much work to do I recently had an 85 page report to do 2 assignments a week that I can't afford to see her as she's from back home. Well be together 5 years this year. Anyway, this is all well and great but for a long time my dream was to travel the world and live somewhere else for several years before coming back to the UK but my girlfriend wants me to get a job in the UK so we can live together. The worst part is it is 100x easier to get a job abroad, and the pay is 100x better abroad but the catch is it's very remote work and I wouldn't be able to talk to her and that scares her.

" First of sorry if this post is hard to comprehend? I have a hard time putting what is going on within my head on ""paper""especially when I'm splitting I can't anymore I just can't I've been crying for a day straight I hate this illness so much, I hate when I split, I hate when I'm not in control. Let's start from the beginning. I have BPD, ADHD, Autism, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder all diagnosed by a licensed professional . I just don't know anymore I need to be there for everyone, I need to take care of the people around me because that's expected. My friends call me complaining about their favorite person and I can't sleep until I find a solution so they don't split. It takes a toll on my already severely damaged mental health. I split for two months after my long distanced boyfriend he they now ex pulled a ""Your BPD autism is too much for me I'm blocking you""on me. I felt a wave of abandonment and fear. I had an emotional flashback to a hell I never wished to revisit. HE KNEW HOW MUCH THAT WOULD HURT AND BREAK ME. They ended up unblocking me a day later. At first, I tried to understand and reason with myself, I told myself that I was worthless and that I'm overreacting, I told myself that I have no right to complain. Sadly I kept on separating them and perceiving them and anyone who spoke kindly of him as evil. I broke up with them two weeks after that stunt. During the break- up with him, before I said ""I think we should break up""I kept on begging him to tell when what I was doing wrong and how we can fix it. He kept saying he was uncomfortable telling ME HIS S O WHAT WAS WRONG IN OUR RELATIONSHIP. Yet he had no fucking problems telling his friends? Nonetheless, things got better, things got so good to the point where I thought my two- month splitting period was over but yesterday someone leaked everything they said about me on their private Instagram account to me when I was having a really bad day. It ranged from mocking my trauma to misgendering me. I forgive easily I am a pushover so at first I was ready to forgive and forget but my mind had a change of plans, now I hate everyone I know right now. I have a vent account on Instagram where I normally let get my feelings out and analyze situations semi- properly but now I can't post anything on there I feel like everyone is watching me, I feel like he's watching me waiting for me to slip up. I've blocked all his accounts except for one because it's unprofessional for me to do so. I am also in 2 group chats with him that I can't really leave due to a currently unchangeable circumstance but everyone in those group chats like him and praises him. When I send things in those group chats I see ""seen by insert his stupid fucking name ""I break a little and my split lasts longer. I want to disappear so I don't have to suffer painful relapses all because I'm too much of a coward to make a scene. I can't even tell if it's the breakup or the BPD all I know is that it hurts. I normally cope by drawing but only digital art because I struggle with traditional art, and all other coping mechanisms never seem to work, but my old iPad broke.

"I'd suggest having these symptoms looked into by a medical professional and perhaps more than one opinion might be helpful, if possible , especially given you're having symptoms at times when you're not anxious. Personally, I had circulatory issues, fatigue, cold hands and feet, and I ended up having an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy CIDP . It took me four neurologists, however, to get a diagnosis, as the first three told me I was fine, and there was nothing wrong with me.

The hoop gives your body an experience of container and teaches safe physical boundaries, which, again, are essential for healing. In fact, I really don't believe healing can happen without it. TSY will help with this to a certain extent but it's just kinda nice when healing can be fun and not such hard work all the time. This road is long and I can tell you're working really hard so it's really important to have some tools that bring levity to the worklighten the load y'know? Anyway, this boundary awareness that I'm talking about happens to some extent on the cognitive but in a huge and really transformative way on the kinesthetic level. The kinesthetic realm makes up an enormous part of our unconsciousand that's where these memories live. If this is of interest to you, and you feel comfortable divulging what city you're in, I'll see if I can connect you to someone in the community Here are the answers to your other questions. Vet school Again, comes down to the safety piece. Based on what I know and have studied, memories won't come up when you're under stress of any kind. Starting a new academic program, especially a rigorous one as yours, isn't likely to register ""safety""with your system. My first big download came when I had taken a 6 month leave of absence from work and was half way through a 10 day silent meditation retreatI was the most at peace I had ever been in my entire life. Practically giddy with zen. And then boom. I can't comment on how it will happen for but trust that they will come up when they but more importantly YOU are ready for them. They're not likely to jump out and turn your life upside down. Well, they might! But only if you're ready and able to deal with them and have supports in place and are in a safe situation in your life. So there's room for things to get turned upside downsafely. The body wants survival above all else, it's not going to risk injury or total meltdown unless it knows, without a shadow of doubt, that the coast is clear. So just keep living your life, doing your work, kicking ass at vet school and be good and kind to yourself. Timing is always perfect. It may not always seem that way! But it is. Fears and paranoia The give- give- give thing. In my experience, that has been tied into boundary issues. Not being able to say no to others because I didn't know my own limits where I ended and the rest of the world began. That kind of thing. Also, needing to please and never knowing where I stood or feeling insecure in my friendships or relationshipsagain because I had no boundaries. Another layer I always knew something was wrong but didn't know what it was so I was compulsively trying to avoid conflict or discord of any kind with anyone. I would sooner walk away from a friendship than discuss an issue. For many years before my memories came back I was obsessed with the thought people were upset at me. My take on this I think this is somewhat natural if you can say that because the abuse imprints us with the core belief that WE are bad or wrong. That core belief then ripples out into everything even though it's the furthest thing from the truth. Again, ""irrational""fears aren't irrational but the way they express as obsessions or compulsions or intrusive thoughts feels illogical because the memory is still fragmented so we don't have context. Relationships There's sooooo much to say here and not sure exactly what kind of issues you're talking about so I'll wax a bit on this but if there's something specific, let me know! So, all trauma is relational. On the one hand, we need relationship in order to heal. On the other, until we're healed, our relationships will tend to mirror the abuse we experienced when we were young. I think this is partly because we tend to gravitate towards what we know, what feels familiar again unconsciously. Because the unconscious mind knows everything. We don't consciously choose people who will hurt us or not support us but our unconscious selves have a magical way of finding these folks and falling madly, deeply, head over heels for them. I've had a tendency to date men who were abusive in one way or another and didn't want to do the work, didn't want to self- examine, blamed me for all their problemsand so, not surprisingly, were unwilling to nurture the relationship or cultivate any real intimacy or connection with me. The last one had his own sex issues as wellwhich he blamed on my trauma. Since I had some pretty collossal self worth issues and an unnatural capacity for compassion and understanding I stayed every time, hoping they would change","I settled hard . How I dealt I just kept trying to do whatever work I could on myself and the relationship from my end . Suffering through it though . Endless bringing up of solutions and begging for him to go to therapy with me . Ultimately just kind of stuck it out until it got so bad I had to leave . My relationships have been pretty painful and kinda soul destroying . Knowing it 's not right and wanting to leave but not being able to . This last one was a bit different though as it felt like it was a vital to my process like part of my education , which it was . I needed every last bit of hardship in that relationship to be where I am now . Now , I know my worth and I regard my time , energy , attention and love as SO unbelievably valuable to me that I 'm not willing to share them with someone who is n't up to par . I have n't been in a relationship since my marriage ended 2.5 years ago but it does n't bother me in the slightest . I had a lot to process after that one so I 've been finding the experience of reconnecting with myself so luxurious and nourishing . And I 'm in no rush because I know that the better I am , the better the partner I 'll attract . As much as we need relationship to heal , the most important relationship is the one we cultivate with ourselves . It 's so bloody cliche but it 's just the truth . I know that the only way I will EVER be in the emotionally , intellectually , sexually fulfilling relationship that I desire is if I create it with myself first .

"For the past 3 days I've been having horrible, persistent anxiety and a couple panic attacks after asking a woman out at work. We went to a park and had some thai food, nothing too intense. I felt the anxiety creeping in during dinner. It was getting chilly so I walked her back to her car and we hugged, then kissed a little. It felt nice. I got home, pretty wired, took my meds prozac and seroquel and a walk around the block to settle down. I fell asleep around ten and woke up after about an hour and that's when the anxiety hit and turned into panic. I was up until about 4 am, whole body tingles, surges of dread, the whole nine yards. I've been wired since and in a fog. Last night she texted and we made plans to meet at another park on Friday. I didn't panic and slept well enough, thanks to a little more seroquel than usual.

"Hey there, I'm glad to hear you've found a way to help you! That sounds like fun, too. I am diagnosed with Cyclothymia, which is basically Bipolar Disorder, and first and foremost my medication has been the most helpful treatment. I'm now a functioning member of society! Before I received professional help, I would spend one day in bed and the next bouncing off the walls. It was a reason why I had to drop out of college. Besides that, writing in a journal is extremely helpful. Putting my thoughts on paper really helps me visualize what I'm feeling and helps me understand what I'm feeling better. It's very cathartic, especially first thing in the morning. Also, exercise! A good release of endorphins will change my mood 180 and, if I do it first thing in the morning, it sets me up for a great day, mood- wise. Lastly, a regular sleep schedule is essential. I know when you're depressed, sometimes going to sleep can be difficult. If you start going to bed and waking up at the same time everyday, I promise it will help.

"Ive been seeing this one therapist for OCD and other things. Ive been going for about 8 months now, and in our last session he mentioned to me that at about a year with clients like me who he figures will be a longer term client rather then just a month or two he likes to check in about progress and see if they feel like theyre making any, and if not, discuss options for what to do about it, be that a new approach or a new therapist. He told me when we started out that he isnt very experienced with people who have OCD about three previous clients if I remember correctly and initially we thought my symptoms were more reflective of anxiety than OCD, so we were focusing more on that, but it became clear about 3 months in that we were dealing with anxiety and also OCD. So here in lies my dilemma - I dont really feel like Ive made a whole lot of progress. I feel like Im either stagnating or in some instances getting worse. I see little moments of change here and there but I dont think its enough to really say its progress. The problem is, I cant tell if its me or him. Ill be honest Im not great at doing exposures the way I should, and my therapist is really understanding of when I dont have the mental headspace to do them Im a junior in college, have a job, an internship, plus whatever other bs personal relational stuff like throws at you . And Im thankful for that, but it also means that I can kinda side track a lot of our sessions to be about other things. I have a self help workbook that he gave me and I worked through about half of it with him, and it seemed helpful as far as actually getting an understanding of HOW you treat OCD, but I also still feel like I very much dont have the tools to try and do ERP effectively. Like I havent found any good ways to make exposures not just terrible for me, or any sort of way to cope or handle or reframe the anxiety so that my brain starts that habituation process. Most of them time when I try to do an exposure I just sit there freaking out and trying to distract myself until I either 1. Spiral into something bad or 2. Inevitably break down and do whatever compulsion I was trying not to do. I also want to add that I like my therapist a lot and I feel pretty comfortable with him, hes really young which helped me feel comfortable with her initially, but hes said herself that its also a bit of a downfall bc there are therapists out there with more years of experience treating OCD than hes even been alive hes 29 if anyone is curious . I do wanna mention that I struggle to talk to him about some of my obsessions compulsions still many of them involve bathrooms and a lot about pooping, and as a result Im super embarrassed to talk about them at all my mom had to email him after a particularly rough night because I knew it was something that he needed to know about but I knew I wouldnt be able to tell him myself .

"Hi everyone! The title says it all, but let me elaborate further. I have been qualified in the my country's top university which I have been dreaming of since high school but got in a program that I don't like very much i.e. I can't see myself practicing Pharmacy in the future for scholarship and financial assistance. Four months into the semester, I became anxious and depressed to the point of quitting and not taking the finals. I was too weak to do the paperwork and luckily my parent was there to help me through the long process of talking to several offices to sign such- and- such documentations. I have also checked myself into therapy prior to this decision they gave me an SSRIescitalopram oxalate . Living away from my family was the easy partI knew how to take care of myself and am responsible enough to live on my own and with others. However, forcing myself into the program gradually emptied me from within. I started having panic attacks when I wake up, thinking that this is another day I have to endure. Soon, my anxiety morphed into depression. I no longer knew what was fun relaxing and my priorities are askew. Throughout all these, I remained functional and responsible, albeit with occasional bouts of crying and morning panic attacksuntil I just gave up. One day, after a series of breakdowns the night before, I had a major mental breakdown which consisted of me crying for hours on end while my mind is on a constant loop of rewinding my stupidity and worthlessness. I was only relieved when I finally admitted that I don't want to pursue this degree and I just want to rest. That was 3 weeks ago. Now, I am at home trying to get better. However, every day still feels like hell because now I'm depressed due to regrets and my giving up the program means I have no concrete career path to get back to. Although my dropping out is just a Leave of Absence for the second semester, I still feel like shit and overall a stupid human being. I don't know what to do exactly with my life and I still have anxious and depressing thoughts that revolve around what career I should take as well as my being ashamed to admit that I stopped going to school because I was too weak.

"I used to follow my ex boyfriend's blog - apparently still do, I saw yesterday. I logged into my account for the first time in over a year, and saw a post he wrote. It appears he is very depressed, and at the ending he wrote ""I am going to commit suicide by x date "".

Him and I have no contact and haven't had any since breaking up. And if she doesn't see the message, should I pursue it further?

"Title says it all. I'm ambitious, intelligent, motivated, healthy, and mostly happy. But there's a part of my life that is seriously lagging behind friends. I always thought I just ""preferred to have a few close friends rather than many 'acquaintances'"", but at this point I'm fairly certain I just come off as egotistical. Here are a few things I've noticed myself doing over the last two months My typical reaction to being asked for help or advice tends to start with words like ""obviously""or ""clearly"". I employ excessive sarcasm when explaining something I consider obvious. I can't come up with conversation fodder that interest others. Consequently, my only friends are those who share many of my interests just one interest is almost never enough. All of my relationships deteriorate after 6- 8 months, when I break up with my partner because literally my reasoning I'm no longer interested. It sounds like I stop learning about people soon after meeting them. I tend to talk about my accomplishments, passively. They permeate my stories or conversations as though they're natural elements of a plot. Then I pass them off with remarks like, ""Oh, that was nothing.""For the record, I don't have any accomplishments that really define me - and none worth discussing. I've had various ""break points""in my life where I believe it became obvious to me that I am rude or callous on a daily basis. This number as of today has reached double digits.

"When I go out anywhere there is other people - or when I spend time with my real life friend - just seeing their his skin really triggers me. I sit there just day- dreaming about how nice it would be to cut their skin, or I analyse the areas of their skin and compare it to mine - for example lately, the upper arm, when I see someone with clean, tight fresh skin, I just fantasize about how good it would be to cut that - and then I just dream about cutting my own I don't have an urge to cut their skin - I just want to see what it is like - no actual will to cut them . I don't know why this triggers me. I feel like it may be jealousy. I envy thin people, who have beautiful skin - and can flaunt it. Envy it so much I hate them most days, because seeing them makes me feel terrible about myself. If not jealousy, why would this be triggering me? Maybe just seeing other peoples skin reminds me I need to keep cutting my own - keep filling it with scar tissue. But, if it is jealousy - how would I deal with that? I really try to stay non- judgmental when I see other people. But it's hard. Often I start off ""Wow, that girl is beautiful - I love how confident she is""- but then it's ""Oh I'm not like that""- and it sends me down a rabbit hole. When I really push non- judgmental stance, I feel like a robot ""That is a woman. I am a woman. She has skin. I have skin.""I just can't.. detatch myself from the emotion that is triggered by people having skin. Any ideas? Either combating the jealousy, the skin issue, or how to better maintain non- judgmental stance when out in public or around my family?","Seeing other peoples skin triggers me .

"Forgive me if this comes across like a rant, but I don't really know how else to describe it. I am in a mental pit. I will be having a birthday soon, I am on the verge of graduating with my undergrad within a couple months, I have an apartment with a great roommate, all of my family is alive and well most of my grandparents included with great pets, I have a great car, but despite all of this, I find it impossible to be happy. I know the phrase usually goes ""count your blessings""and truly I do every day. I am thankful for all of the positives that are in my life because I do realize that things could be far, far, worse than they are now, but the negatives that corrupt my mind are too much for me to take. I am in the boat where I feel like if anyone does anything for me it is a burden. Even if it is just something as simplistic asking me ""How are you?""I can't let anybody do anything for me because I feel like I do not deserve it. I shut most people out of my life and what people there are in my life I cannot open up to out of fear of pushing them away. I have recently lost a close friendship with a best friend of nearly 8 years just this year, I have an ex who cheated on me after an extended relationship with a man who claims to be a man of God and is now engaged to him on top of that, now claiming to be a woman of God herself. Even though I knew she loved him, she denied it any time we would talk when I was in a REALLY bad state after she broke up with me . There is more to that, but I don't want to pelt this board with that mess. I feel like I am going through the motions on a near daily basis with no sense of purpose. I find that the only ways I can mentally escape are seeing my family who are not local , video games movies shows, marijuana, and that's about it. My friends are great people and I am truly thankful to have them in my life I really only have three or four that I would consider close and don't go out of my way to talk to many others , but not one of them has a clue of my mental state right now and anytime I have attempted to open up to them, I feel like they have no idea of where I'm coming from and I leave them hopeless with no idea of how to help me. The only one that did was my friend that I no longer talk to as mentioned. I have not made a friend in my college on my own since moving up here. My family is littered with so much bullshit of their own, that I feel like even opening up to them is nothing but more pain onto their pile that they already have. It's a cliche, but ""feeling alone in a crowded room""is how it feels like I am on a daily basis. I'm OK with being alone at times, but when I am in a state like this, I just don't know. I have tried meeting girls and got close to one for a few months who ended up moving away because she herself was unhappy and needed to go back to where she was happy and that sent me into a spin. I feel like I have the reverse midas touch in that anything I touch turns to shit. There was another girl over a year ago that I was afraid to date on account of how my ex from above would have reacted at the time and I feel like I broke her heart and don't know how to live with being a heartbreaker. Most of my ex's have cheated on me in the past some for sure, others speculated while I did nothing but go out of my way to make sure that they were as happy as they could possibly be. One of them I have not spoken to in many years and I still have no idea of why she broke up with me the way she did. I got a job to try to direct my pain towards that and turn it into something positive. At first, it was going very well but in the last month has sort of fizzled out and has now become another source of my depression as opposed to anything close to resembling a relief. I have seen a therapist once but not since I was just in double digits. I did not think it helped me then with issues not pertaining to this post that I won't delve into and truly have no idea if it would help me now but I have no idea what really could. My main methods of relief all have their limitations and there is seemingly no end in sight to making this go away","I am a blessed individual who has gotten far more than what I feel I deserve and that most people in my age - group would be highly grateful for , but regardless of all of the blessings that I have had over the years , I am a complete basketcase that has no idea on how to live with some of the choices that I have made and how to find happiness going forward , other than with the few things that I mentioned that allow a temporary relief .","I feel like I am in a pit of depression and I don't know how to get out of it.

I have tried talking to my friends and family, but I feel like they have no idea where I'm coming from and I leave them hopeless with no idea of what to do to help me. I just want to give up on everything and just end it all. I do not want to live like this anymore. I want to be happy again, but the only thing that keeps me from doing so is the thought of hurting my family and friends that I have left behind. I know that there are people out there that care about me and want to help, but at the same time, I feel that I am too much of a burden to put them through that and I am not sure how to open up to them out of fear of pushing them away.

"My self- loathing and perfectionism made me paranoid and I pushed my boyfriend away. He was nothing but supportive and tried to understand me but I couldn't talk to him about my feelings so I shut him out.

"Hello! So, I got a job a little over a year and a half ago working for a pet sitting dog walking company. To be brief, I very much enjoyed it, but it required me to drive around a lot. I had multiple seizures over a 72 hour span and had to quit, as my license was revoked for six months and no one else was allowed to drive or be with me during pet visits. My boss cried when I left. I recently got my roommate a job there by serving as a reference! When my boss saw my name on her resume, she asked how I was doing. I was also looking for a job, and decided to give another pet- sitting company a go now that I've been seizure free for over a year. One of the companies I had sent my resume to reached out to my boss for a reference. She immediately called me once she got off of the phone and asked me if I would like my job back now that I'm doing better! OF COURSE! I've been back there for about three weeks now. Things have changed a bit, but not enough to throw me out of the routine I had established for consultations and pet visits. I went out for a consultation two nights ago. The woman I met with introduced me to her dogs, and then was kind of all over the place for the next 50 minutes I clock in and out for each consult or pet visits and I'm not supposed to be anywhere beyond 30 minutes, really . She spoke incessantly the entire time I was there, her thoughts were rather disorganized, and I wasn't going to be rude and ignore her! She seemed very anxious and very off, but I tried to go with it. I can relate! But she made me so anxious myself that I had two panic attacks while I was there. I think I hid them well other than sweating and a flushing face. Yesterday evening, I received a text from my boss asking to return the owner's house key to her. A little while later, she explained why. Apparently, the owner had spoken to them. My boss explained that ""part of it was that she didn't feel like you really bonded with the dogs at the consult. She was worried that you wouldn't play with them while she was gone""There is a fucking 100- something page MANUAL now for the company I work for. She was in the process of writing it when I worked there previously, so when I was re- hired, this was my first time seeing it. It states that during consultations, especially when we first arrive, to acknowledge the animals pets but not to give them excessive attention because we don't know how they'll respond to it and because we really need to be communicating the the owner about their needs during a consultation. SHE even told me that when I got my job back! I thought I was doing what I was supposed to do. I left thinking that, especially considering the panic attacks, that I rocked the consult. I had my notes ready, took more, was shown around to everything I needed to access while I was there, etc. But, no. I blew it. I feel like a piece of shit now. I really felt like I was doing things appropriately. I didn't totally ignore the dogs! I spent a good 10- 15 minutes messing with them and on my knees on the floor. And with how much she was talking more like rambling, but , I thought I did especially well at balancing my human dog interaction. But no. I'm not a goddamned mind reader! Now I feel like I'm going to approach a dog too quickly in the future and really fuck things up. I need an outside opinion on this How much do I really suck? This is probably going to haunt me all day","Work for a pet sitting company that does consultations before the sitting begins . I met with a very anxious and scatterbrained woman . She contacted my boss after I left and said she was n't pleased with how I interacted with her dogs and canceled her reservations .

"I dont know how else to say it without sounding crazy but if he doesnt kill me I will finish the job myself. I suffered four years of domestic abuse by someone that is almost a decade older than me. I was 13 when we first dated which is so sick and fucked up. At the time I was super impressionable and didn't know what was so wrong and that I was 'mature for my age'. It was SO wrong, he abused and took advantage of me so many times that I nearly dropped out of school. This happened until I graduated high school. He broke up with me saying he didn't desire me anymore which honestly shattered me. He made me dependent on him during those four years, i would get in trouble for talking to any boy, he bugged my phone, he'd call me names and made me so suicidal that I'd drink bleach, eat pills, cut, anything. At the time it was a ""i want help""suicidal. Now its evolved into a ""i dont care anymore""suicidal. I got a boyfriend ASAP after that because I needed someone to fill the gap otherwise I'd just kill myself. I became madly in love with him. He went to the same schools as me since middle school so we are the same age and he's incredibly smart and rational which is what I need because I'm incredibly irrational and emotionally fucked up. Months later my ex asks to get back with me and begs. I feel guilty because secretly I wanted to get back with him. I explained this to my boyfriend but he understood it was because I had an emotional dependency on him and that it wasn't my fault, as long as I try to break away from it. I tried so hard. Later I have a dream about my ex crucifying me, stabbing me. Strangely I really liked the idea of my ex knifing me.

"Hey everyone, So I have this friend who has tried on 4 diff occasions to kill herself. I had to come here for some insight because I don't want to say anything to her, and I wanna know if I'm js stupid or if there's some validity to my thoughts. Firstly, she's an online friend, so I can't help her in person whatsoever. But I'm really scared to say this, but I don't actually think she wants to kill herself. Something tells me that she uses these ""attempts""as a means of more self- harm than actually something lethal. I think it's a means to cope with her depression and volatile family life that caused her to be this way. I think it's a way for her to get a thrill and a rush, which is a level of excitement that she is deprived of. Obviously, I don't want to say any of this to her, because I know the most important thing is prioritizing her safety and respecting her emotions and words. However, she also talks abt her suicide attempts SO frequently. She basically uses it as a conversation starter with other ppl. And she jokes abt it and laughs and treats it as if it's something cool. She is so unbelievably nonchalant abt it, and so chill abt it, that it makes me believe more that she doesn't actually have that natural fear of death because she's never planning to go that far in the first place. I feel terrible for assuming that, and for now I'm treating this very seriously and respecting what she tells me, but I just need help if anyone is willing or able. I just needed to voice my concerns, as well as get help from someone because I just don't know what to do. I don't want to use the suicide hotline or whatever because she's in a whole diff continent and I feel like she would despise me trying to get her to call it. She just tried to OD last night and ""failed"". Now she's back in our discord server joking about it and talking abt it like she js went to Disneyland. I'm js longing for 2 things rn that this vicious cycle of joking and attempts stops, and, most importantly, that she's safe. She's only 16, and she tells me that the main source of her depression stems from her issues w her parents. I just want her safe. She has so much to experience in this world, and she deserves to see what life has to offer her. If she could js make it a couple more years, she could be out of that house and living her life. I want that for her. And ik this isn't necessarily my responsibility, but I would feel terrible if something happened and I didn't try to do something to stop it. Idk if this is right, but I really am trying my best. It's just hard caring for someone when they don't rlly seem like they give a fuck abt you, their situation, or themselves. TY to everyone who read everything, I'm sorry for the lack of brevity","Online friend , 16 , attempted suicide 4 times .

"In Spring of 2019, my ex boyfriend, who I had been with nearly 4 years, tried to kill me. He then ended his life in custody. I have been in DV counseling since, and honestly at this point, Im doing pretty alright. Or, I thought I was. I met a man Oct 2019, and yesterday was our 1 year together. Yesterday was also the first time Ive felt the same paralyzing fear that I did when my ex started his assault on me. My boyfriend didnt hit me, or physically hurt me in any way. But his words, his behavior, just the vibes radiating from his body I was so scared. Too scared to sleep, even after he had been calm for a few hours. Now Im sitting at home, waiting for him to tell me hes home from work, and Im so ashamed its happening again. Im so ashamed that Im letting myself be in this situation. He is the only man to see my 13 inch scar, from when a hunting knife eviscerated me. Hes the man who assured me that, despite the scar of the slur that was carved into my face, I was still so pretty. Hes the man who helped my confidence shoot up, to where I actually feel not just comfortable in the skin Im in, but beautiful . Hes also the man who has made me give up my best friend of 13 years, because that person was a man. Im not allowed to answer a phone call around him unless its my mom or grandma. Im not allowed to sit in his gaming chair, because I weigh too much I kid you not, his exact words . I get yelled at for not cleaning an apartment I dont live in, and yelled at when I come over and clean because Im not paying attention to him. I have some mental disabilities, and sometimes my words make sense to me but not to others - and I get yelled at then, too, because hes taken offense when none was meant.

"I know it's tempting because it's a quick solution, but it's actually a perfect way to maintain your anxiety. I'll give as brief an explanation of this as I can, but I think it's important to understand why these meds are a bad idea With anxiety disorders, what is happening is that people learn to fear a situation that is much less dangerous than they expect it to be. Most people acclimate to these situations and don't feel anxious the ones that continue feeling anxious cope with the anxiety by engaging in ""safety behaviors.""A safety behavior is a response to an anxiety- provoking situation that is designed to avoid an unrealistic but feared outcome for example, washing your hands after touching a doorknob . Engaging in this behavior prevents the individual from learning the real level of danger in the situation because they assume their safety behavior is what prevented the feared outcome in this example, getting sick . Thus, the situation is still feared and the safety behavior continues to be relied upon in these situations instead of just realizing that it's pretty unlikely you're going to get a serious illness from a doorknob , and the individual never learns not to fear that outcome. So, taking benzos is a form of a safety behavior it will teach you that you can only endure the feared situations if you are on the meds, and it will simply maintain or even worsen your anxiety in that situation. It's a bandaid that does nothing to address the things maintaining your anxiety. This is supported by some pretty strong empirical evidence. I would suggest seeing a therapist for treatment for anxiety the behavioral treatments are extremely effective. Anxiety disorders are very well understood and are pretty easy to treat. I would suggest this route first! ",Do n't use benzos to treat anxiety ! ! It wo n't go away and it might get worse ! plus they 're habit - forming ,"Benzos are a bandaid that doesn't do anything to address your anxiety, and they will only teach you how to endure the feared situation if you are on the meds. See a therapist for treatment first.",Benzos are a bandaid that does nothing to address the underlying issues causing your anxiety.

"So- for context, I am in high school currently. When I was in elementary school, I was a seriously crappy child- horrible performance in school, horrible behavior, horrible social skills. And for some reason, whenever I got pissed which was a lot and threw tantrums, one of those things I always said was ""I'm going to kill myself.""I didn't actually plan on doing so it was just something that popped into my head. Maybe I wanted the attention. Who knows. It just sort of sprung out of my immature anger episodes. Obviously the counselors there freaked out, and that wasn't very fun I transitioned to middle school, and then high school, and I guess all the anger management issues sorta dissipated. Don't throw tantrums, don't get angry very easily. Except sometimes, when I do get pissed, or whenever I think about conflicts going on currently, I might not have the outbursts of my youth, but sometimes the image of killing myself does pop up in my head. The images take several forms. There are a couple methods that I won't mention because of rule 1b. I don't picture actually committing the act, but sometimes I picture my lifeless body just lying there, sometimes someone I know finding me. Other times I picture myself about to do it before someone walks in. I consider the notes I'd write, the strategic choosing of the location, to find some sort of symbolic significance for it. Most commonly I picture people I know- a lot of people, friends, and teachers especially, but almost never my mother- finding out about the news and reacting to it. I suppose it's sort of a ""ha! Now they feel bad""type of thing. Just my gut instinct when I feel I need psychological revenge. In no way am I actually suicidal. Whenever I think about this kinda crap, the emotions do run fairly intense. But I have plenty of reasons and no problem with convincing myself to live- and other times my mind drifts, the episode is forgotten and the rest of the day is uneventful. To my perspective, it's just sort of a way my brain lets off steam, a weird remnant from my unstable elementary school years. By my judgement, it's not detrimental or major or anything. I do realize that this sorta thing is hardly normal. I recently informed my mother of this stuff Dad's divorced and lives out- of- state , and obviously she was seriously concerned, and definitely justified in being so. Even so, I tried to explain what I did in the fourth paragraph above, that to me, it's no big deal, but that expectedly didn't do much to quell her woes. She now worries that I'm too lonely at school not the case , that I'm harboring anger within myself that I'm not revealing to her not the case , that I have depression extremely unlikely She's begun taking me to a counselor to talk about this, in the hopes that among other things there are other issues I'm not divulging I'll find ways to ""deal with anger more positively.""I go to my second visit tomorrow, and while I have no problem sitting and talking, completely honestly, I say it's a waste of time, a waste of money, and an overreaction. Yeah, I know that's what mothers do, and I don't expect to change her view anytime soon But her concern is one that I should probably take into consideration. From what I've explained, do you think that these sorts of thoughts are dangerous? Unhealthy?","In elementary school , had anger management issues and spouted phrase ""I 'm gon na kill myself ""out of immaturity now in high school , images of suicide pop into my head in response to anger or stress , though I do n't have any plans or motivations and in general am a pretty normal guy .

"Maybe this is just a vent. Whatever. An outsider's perspective. I'm court ordered three meetings a week. It's been about eight months already, maybe another eight to go. Who knows.

"Hey there friends. I am suffering with severe anxiety four years now, and I've had my fair share of depressive episodes. However in my house the word 'depression' is not even allowed to be uttered, and these are called slumps, low patches, bad days and more. So for a long time I normalized how bad my symptoms were. I am starting to realize now that everything is not normal. When I am severely and terribly anxious, or depressed, or whatever someone would like to label it - I feel like I leave my body. I watch situations from third person. I do not feel things. It feels like nothing is happening. Sometimes I even feel like I could narrate what is happening around me, and I think about doing destructive things like killing myself at this time. These . episodes? happen randomly. Not all the time but often enough to be scary. It has happened a lot when drinking alcohol or when I am alone and mentally overwhelmed, but now it has moved to when I am socially mixing and happy. My life has gone downhill in 6 months that's all I can say, every aspect, shit. So I was sitting with my friends in mcdonalds at three am after my friends birthday and it happened. My friend mentioned something about my boyfriend who had dumped me two days before and before I knew it, I just kind of left. And I knew I was acting different, and PEOPLE could SEE, see I never let people see anything but me smiling 24 7 always happy always joking always kind. I left and I couldn't even change it?

"Yes. I can relate. My experience with psychiatric clinicians in hospitals has been generally awful. Most recently I was treated as a non person. My concerns didn't matter. Even after I reported serious adverse results from an ECT gone wrong, they took 4 days to even return my calls. They were powerfully incurious about what had happened to me and how I was doing. That call lasted 2min and I haven't heard from them since. Now I'm very wary when I see professionals with those behaviors. I understand why they pulled him out.

"As someone with C- PTSD and ADHD, I believe the neurological disorder vs mental illness can actually be a bit of both. I see ADHD - and particularly the 'brain literally functions processes things differently' - as being closer more accurately described as neurological. However, the struggles from feeling and or being able to function especially for those who weren't diagnosed till adult life, or weren't given enough info choices in their treatment can manifest similar to trauma long term stress. It can definitely put us in a constant or on- and- off state of high anxiety, depression, chronic high stress, etc. My psychiatrist recently explained the difference between 'high anxiety' and general social anxiety - and the 'high anxiety' is a lot more serious and debilitating, you really can't, and shouldn't, live with it. My first few session have primarily been about diagnosis, and getting that anxiety down to a safe amp manageable level. Even starting therapy was held off until anxiety was lowered, because in that constant, PTSD level anxiety made therapy a bad idea would do more harm than good ","ADHD can be both , a neurological disorder difference , and cause a sort of ' mental illness ' due to the anxiety stress frustration depression etc from living with ADHD particularly undiagnosed , or not with optimal treatment for that individual ","I think it's a bit of both, but I don't think ADHD is the same thing as PTSD.

"Hi everyone Ill keep this short - been in a relationship for 3 months with a lovely lady. She was really honest and told me from the outset she has BPD and as you can imagine I have been trying to research ever since. She has had a few crisis moments where she has pushed me away, shes been very mature and honest about it and told me she needs time for herself. Thats all been okay so far and I have been able to deal with it, she comes back later that day or the next day and we make it up and she is back to her normal self again. The reason Im reaching out is that I made a comment on Wednesday which was meant as a joke but she took seriously. It blew up into a brief argument but it has now settled and when we talk it is okay. However I can tell she is not herself and she is trying to act normally so as not to worry me. She goes for long periods without messaging me and has told me she is scared of hurting me and that I should leave before she does hurt me. I have tried to base my response on what I think she needs, I have been patient and kind and rational and assured her that I am there if she wants me there. I am really worried now as this is the longest 3 days this mood has gone on for. I dont know whether to dodge the elephant in the room and distract her or face it head on and ask how she feels. She is constantly putting herself down and cannot see why Im with her despite my continued reassurance. Could anyone suggest anything I can do to help her work through it and also help me about how long this may last? She always goes back to being herself but it doesnt take this long normally. Final bits of info - we are not living together, we are in the U.K. under lockdown and havent seen each other for a month - previously seeing each other each weekend which has had a toll on both of us.

"And most of the guys I meet do at least want to hook up even if they may not admit itit's their mannerisms around me. I had made a post a while back about twins. In my post I had named the identical twins Bob and Barry. The twin I am dating is Barry. This past week, Bob and Barry had a Halloween party and I talked to Bob's wife more hoping she could be a new girl to hang out with and I wouldn't have to worry about her hitting on the guy I'm dating because every time I try to befriend a single girl, the single girls always end up dating my exes and I just can't trust people because of that Well in my last post, I told people how I tried to hide my crush for Bob, especially since I'm sort of hanging out with Barry now. It was apparent at the party that I think Bob has a crush on me, too, but neither of us ever speak of it since he's married and I'm dating his single twin, Barry. I think the wife could sense it. I think even Barry could sense it because he was looking at the both of us funny while Bob and I were sitting next to each other on the couch playing video gamesso the next time, I just moved away from Bob. I don't want to lose Bob as a friend because he has been a good friend to me, but this insane secret crush may be the end point and it sucks that I may lose two people. Bob and I have more interests in common than Barry and I do and Bob doesn't have kids. I just hate the situation that Bob is married. I just wonder how long Bob can go before he cracks that he does have a crush on me. After the party, we've kept our distance, and I've been into Barry more.

"warning, a bit of a long winded post. Since my diagnosis, I've been having some very painful self- reflections and coming to terms with the fact that I was the bad guy in many of the situations when I was sure it was my ex's fault. My reasons weren't based off reality. IE I would think his love for me was waning if he didn't text me first for a whole day, textbook bpd thinking and I would act out either passively aggressively by being cold, disappearing for hours and not answering his texts, because I wanted him to feel like I didn't care about him either. I realize now that this behavior is pretty classic example of splitting. I have spent the last 8 months alone with myself, not dating, not being in a relationship, because I knew that having that external relationships was the only thing that kept me feeling like I existed, without external validation, I've been a very empty shell of a person sinking deeper into depression every day. I broke all that last night when I called my ex. I had a trigger last night that ended up with me employing ALL my destructive coping mechanisms, drugs, alcohol, and cherry on top, calling my ex. My family and friends hate him because they've only heard the awful parts that I shared with them and that I was so sure about before I would conveniently fail to mention the many awful things I did and said to him though . I'm just questioning everything now. I'm looking back at our old texts and now with some self - awareness I can see clearly just through those texts the times I felt vulnerable threatened and would make a problem out of seemingly nothing. I basically sabotaged the relationship, and this isn't even the first time. He always takes me back, even though it's been months, one time a year, and now this would be the third time that I'm just re- inserting myself into his life even though I ended things back in Dec. I made up in my head that he was cheating on me, and though I had no proof I confronted him about it anyway to see how he'd respond and depending on his response I'd decide if it was true or not. I think no matter what response he gave me I would have arrived to the same conclusion- that he is def cheating on me and so now I must disconnect and disappear. Writing this out is sobering, because I see now how flawed my thinking is, and how fucked up my subsequent actions are to how I think. What really blows my mind now, is why he would take me back, now 3x that I've left him, blocked him from my life, and then pop back in when I need him. He's so ready to jump back in and try again. It makes me so suspicious, because he doesn't seem afraid at all of me doing it again, if he was afraid he wouldn't be so quick to want to get back together again. And if he was really hurt by me leaving, wouldn't he be wary of letting that happen to him again? I just don't trust my thoughts right now. Any advice is appreciated","Since my diagnosis , I 'm no longer confident that my ex is a pathological narcissist , and that maybe , I just split on him . 8 months later 3rd ""split ""I pop back in his life and he 's too readily willing to get back into a relationship with me , and I have extreme distrust of not only him , but now myself as well .","I think my ex is cheating on me even though I've left him 3 times and he always takes me back, even though it's been months, one year, and now this would be the third time that I'm just re - inserting myself into his life even after I ended things back in Dec.

All drug testing labs screen for the SAMHSA NIDA 5 Cannabinoids marijuana , Cocaine including crack cocaine , Amphetamines amphetamine and methamphetamine , Opiates Opioids heroin, opium, codine, morphine , and PCP. The initial screening is done with a cheap test that is not very accurate. If it returns positive, a confirmation test is done with a more expensive, more accurate method, like GC MS gas chromatograhy mass spectrometry .

In the last couple years I've been suffering from night sweats and sometimes hot flashes during the day. I've been tested for everything else possible, so I'm now attributing it to my meds. Today I had an appointment and checked my blood pressure, it's quite high. So now I'm staring down the possibility of taking blood pressure medication on top of everything else. But I have no known family history of high blood pressure. Again, Effexor has high blood pressure as a possible side effect. My thought is to try transitioning to a different medication, hopefully with less side effects for me. Has anyone had an experience like this? Or have a medication that has worked for their depression and anxiety? I have a phone appointment with my doc next Monday, so I wouldn't be doing anything without her approval and support","Taking Effexor , hot flashes and high blood pressure as side effects .

"Hi everyone. This is a side account that I haven't really used. I've been lurking on this subreddit for the past few days, and I'm creating this topic to hopefully get some advice. This will probably be pretty long, so I apologize. I'm a 27 year old male who has been dealing with health anxiety on and off for about five years now. My biggest fear throughout this time has been colon cancer. It started with a two week bout of constipation. I googled the possible cause, and of course CC was one of the possibilities. I saw my family doctor about it, and he wasn't very concerned. It said I could see a specialist if it didn't clear up, but fortunately it did. Unfortunately, this started a trend of myself googling any symptoms that came up, and getting freaked out. In that first year I saw my doctor countless times for things like heart disease and skin cancer worries. The longest lasting symptom that worries me is what I'm posting about right now. Shortly after my first visit, I noticed that I had this pain in my lower abdomen. When I press on my lower abdomen near my hip bones, it hurts. It tends to be more painful on the right than my left. My family doctor sent me for two ultrasounds one in 2015, and on in 2017, and I also got a blood test shortly before the second ultrasound. These tests came back clear, and my doctor didn't order any further testing. I didn't push for more tests, because I thought that would feed my health anxiety, but the tenderness has never really gone away. So, fast forward to now. I've been living in a different city for about a year now, and I started to get worried about my tenderness again. I went to a walk in clinic yesterday to try and get my abdomen checked. The doctor was initially concerned about my appendix, which I'v thought about myself. He scheduled another ultrasound in three weeks. If that doesn't find the problem, I'm going to get a CT scan, and if that doesn't find anything, I'm going to get a colonoscopy. I mentioned to him that I was worried my pain was being caused by a tumor in my bowel, and he said it was very unlikely due to my age and not having any family history of bowel disease. I went to a GI specialist four years ago for some blood on the toilet paper, which turned out to be hemorrhoids. I don't have frequent diarrhea or any other noticeable signs of bowel issues that I can think of. My only real symptom is abdominal tenderness. I'm trying to stay away from googling, but I'm still feeling very worried. I'm worried that this could be something serious, and that I waited too long to get it looked at thoroughly. I'm really regretting not pushing for more tests years ago. I'm very afraid of what the CT scan or colonoscopy with find. My ultrasound isn't for another three weeks, and it will likely take months for me to get the CT scan and colonoscopy. How to I stop being so anxious until I get the tests?","I 've had abdominal tenderness for close to five years , and have only had ultrasounds , which found nothing .

"So in order to properly explain my dilemma, a bit of backstory is required. At the beginning of the year i found myself In- patient at a local hospital for SH and suicidal ideations. I m20 meet a girl f23 there who, over the course of the 2 weeks, I grew close to. As luck would have it, we were from the same town and when we were both released, we spent quite a bit of time together. We told each other that a relationship wouldnt be healthy but never the less we grew closer. fast forward to a couple month ago, she had a failed suicide attempt and her parents shipped her away to residential program. We kept in touch and this week she will be returning home for a couple day before moving even further away for a step- down program. Ive come to terms that we cant have any relationship other then occasional text messages and that soon, may very well be the last time I ever see her, but here's where the kicker comes. Ever since we were in the hospital together, I had this desire to have her cut me. I dont know where it came from as i never experienced anything similar before, but I cant seem to shake it and its all i can really think about. With a few days from now being my only chance, I want to ask her if she'll do it. At the same time im worried she'll freak and ill lose what little communication i could have with her. She has never selfharmed herself but was comfortable with it being part of my history even though she didnt condone it and tried to convince me to quit on multiple occasions",I m fucked in the head and about to ruin the only friendship i have left . inb4 this get removed for not technically being self - harm lol,I have a desire to cut myself and i want to ask my ex - gf if she 'll do it but i m worried she wo nt do it and i 'll lose what little contact i have with her.,I want to ask a girl I grew close to if she 'll cut me out of her life before I see her in person in a few days.,"I want to ask a girl I grew close to if she 'll cut me when she's back from residential program in a few days.

"Going to short form this so it's not too long. If you have questions or anything then please do ask. I'll tell you everything. Met this girl on tinder I know I know and we became friends. We talked for a few days and then we connected when I was there for her the entire night she was going to attempt her life. I helped her as much as I could. Texted and called and played games with her all night. Didn't let 5 minutes go by without a check up text. The next day we became really good friends. Everything was great until she ghosted me a bit after we hung out IRL because she had once said that she ghosts people when she gets too close with them. I let it go because i'm not gonna be able to do anything about it. I kept texting her though and face timing. We started talking more and hung out at the bar twice and my friends say that she ""was all over you""but she was drunk. But we were hanging out and talking and having fun. The first time we bumped into each other. She told my friend that night she wanted to have sex with me but I didn't see it. I'm just blind to hints and believing people. We hung outside after the bar closed and we were hugging and talking and chilling because it was cold. Before her DD came we were close and I was holding her and trying to make her feel warm. She was looking at me and I kissed her forehead after a moment of staring at each other. I see it in my dreams. It's a bliss dream and a nightmare at the same time. Maybe I did the right thing kissing her forehead. I think it was so wrong. She didn't react. I don't remember if she did. It's just the kiss on the forehead and looking that is in my head. She's ghosting me now for the most part. We don't text. I send her some texts every so often just to get my friends beanie back that she took while drunk the bar night. She's coming tomorrow to pass it off. It will probably be the last time I ever see her. I'm thinking of asking if she remembers that night. What happened. If it was a wrong move. I just need closure. It's eating at me. I think it's the reason we're drifting. It's fine if it happens. I can accept it happening now but I just need to know. I'm very introverted and not confident whatsoever.

My main qualification at uni was to design pharmaceuticals which is more chemistry but I did do degree level neuropharmacology so here is my best attempt at explaining it please feel free to add or refute bits . So to give a very basic overview has been a while since uni so feel free to correct any mistakes I make . I am also going to gradually ramp up the science as it goes on. Dopamine starts in midbrain which effects dopamine at the frontal cortex of the brain which effects dopamine in basal ganglia which effects dopamine in the midbrain making a circle . You also get dopamine from the basal ganglia effecting the prefrontal cortex and back again this is the current main focus of ADHD that this back and forth isn't as well developed and this leads to the symptoms of adhd although there is very likely a lot more involved and some more neurotransmitters . Here is a nice little review of dopamine pathways General not ADHD specific ,It is complicated and has probably to do with dopamine but also likely a load more things . Sorry for all spellings ect and please do correct anything that is wrong or add extra to it .,Dopamine starts in midbrain which effects dopamine at the frontal cortex of the brain which affects dopamine in basal ganglia which effect dopamine in the midbrain making a circle. This leads to the symptoms of adhd but there is likely a lot more involved and some more neurotransmitters.,Dopamine pathways in the midbrain affect the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain which in turn affect the adhd symptoms.,Dopamine starts in midbrain and travels to other parts of the brain.

"Sorry In advance for the following essay Ive been smoking cannabis almost religiously since I was about 12 13 yrs old, anywhere from an 1 4 to half oz a day at least. when I was 19 I spent a month in jail, and it was the longest I had ever stopped smoking completely. I used it for pain Im 29 and looking at my second back surgery in the next few months, trust me, I know pain very well as well as anxiety, and a range of other issues that I felt like it was helping with. I havent stopped smoking completely as of now but due to my financial situation and some other factors, my intake has slowed to almost nothing over the last few weeks, maybe a gram over the last week, IF that, and Im completely fine with it. Its been about 4- 5 days since Ive smoked any significant amount. But now Im starting to realize that my dreams are insanely more vivid.

But, if this is what has to happen to be able to have those types of dreams again, Im all in. When I was younger I used to have the most lucid dreams Ive ever heard of.

"Im so damn impulsive. Ill get caught on the idea of doing something randomly and absolutely HAVE to do it or I cant rest.

I just do and then think later. Often Ill do something, then midway through become fully self aware of what Im doing and loose all interest and jump to another thing.

"I have been told that the ADD medication coud help a lot and turn off the mental noise That statement held some truth for me. It did help me turn off the mental noise and help me focus and get work done which then made me feel good about myself. But, in the long term, in my case, oh god did those medications kick me around the rose bush. It's probably because my family has a history of bipolar and other mental illness, but that medication was a complete floozy for me.

"This is a constant thing but I felt I needed to vent.. about the irony, that the relationships I ended up in, all of which were toxic and most of them ab sive I partially censor the word just cuz I know Im easily triggered and in case anyone else is , were all relationships I didnt have a true desire for. In fact, at least that I can remember, I have never once sought out relationships with others.. btw Im female and used to being with males but I dont consider myself straight and I dont identify with a particular orientation. Ive had crushes since I was a kid pre- ptsd, then it became just weird attachment if anything and trauma bonding , but I never had some goal to date, have relationships, marry, settle down, mess around, etc., and Ive long wondered if I was on the ACE spectrum, blah blah. Its more like I always had a need for validation and had very low self esteem to begin with even pre- trauma. But I never could really picture myself in relationships in a realistic way, and relationships never felt fully natural to me. I could go on and analyze myself and the reasons behind that whether its been due to severe anxiety and social anxiety and OCD and MDD since I was like 4 or 5, that its due more to trauma that happened later, or whatever orientation I might me, or a combination of whatever, but whatever the reasons are I just never felt natural in relationships and didnt seek them out or feel like they were necessary. I wanted to be liked and validated and accepted is all. I mainly only ended up in relationships because of my inability to say no, especially as a kid and teenager I literally couldnt say no, if a guy would ask me out i would just feel scared and say yes because maybe I feared their reaction if I said no or didnt wanna hurt their feelings. Always poor boundaries both with those I was around and with myself. Then those relationships happened to usually be with someone I hadnt even had a dinky little crush on or considered, and then, as I tried to navigate and just be a good girlfriend, I ended up abused in several ways, multiple times, by multiple people over the years, and some of them were straight up narc ab ser types. My high school social worker was the only one who helped me when I was in my first relationship which also happened to be the first ab sive thing in various ways, and the social worker taught me the different forms of it, like emotional etc., bc as a teenager I didnt know. I was really messed up after that first experience but it wasnt too another couple of experiences some years later, and the aftermath of all this, that I was diagnosed with PTSD. Then several years later after becoming chronically ill due to a doctors medical negligence I ended up in a relationship again despite my fears and unresolved issues and although they werent like my exes in most ways, not a narc, not ab sive, just had some issues like I have mine.. I end up turned on and abandoned in a horrible way again after years w them and my PTSD is worse than before, and my OCD, my health and everything else. And it was also following the loss of my fur baby which was also something premature and tragic and she was my best friend and like an emotional support pal pet.. so since last year Ive just been more stuck than ever and my now- ex got to move on, he knew my history with previous relationships, my PTSD etc. and as usual it was the other party who initially tried to know me and be in my life and I try to be careful and cant feel normal feelings but Im the one who tries to endure everything and then I end up betrayed yet again","I never sought relationships to begin with , people sought them with me , but I m the one who s traumatized and debilitated now after allowing people in my life , giving them a chance . I m always the fool in the end , and the one with the life - altering damage . Does anyone else relate to this ? Particularly women ? I m just always stunned at the irony of my life .","I have nt been in relationships since I was a kid and I do nt know if it s due to anxiety, OCD, OCD and MDD, or a combination of all of the above, but I just never felt comfortable in relationships and did nt seek them out or feel like they were necessary to me.

I ve always felt like I had a need to be liked and validated and wanted to be accepted by others, but never felt natural to be in a relationship bc of my fear of rejection and inability to say no. I ended up being abused in several ways by multiple people over the years and ended up diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, OCD and MDD, and I m still dealing with a lot of trauma. I do nt know if I m on the spectrum or if it s something else, but I m just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and if so, how they dealt with it.","I ve always had a need for validation and validation in relationships and never felt like I was ever meant to be in one bc I ve never had a desire to date or settle down or have a relationship of any kind, never felt natural in relationships or felt like they were necessary or natural to me, ended up being abused multiple times by multiple people over the years and now I m more stuck than ever bc I ca nt say no to anyone anymore and my PTSD is worse than before, and my OCD, my health and everything else is suffering from the aftermath of all this and I do nt know how to get out of this cycle of always being hurt and betrayed and abused by people who initially tried to get to know me and be in my life and then end up abandoning me again after years of trying to navigate and navigate and be a good girlfriend.

"Hi all. My ex and I were together for 2 years, and throughout that time he sexually abused me, gaslighted me, and coerced me into doing things I didn't want to do. He'd pressure me to have sex nearly every time we hung out. When I said no he'd get angry with me saying it was ""my fault""for leading him on. When I finally got the nerves to say my consent was not being valued, he claimed he still wasn't at fault, and blamed me for not being clear even though I said ""no""or ""not today""out loud to him . I broke up with him awhile ago but those times still haunt me. I spoke with a therapist and supportive family who all agree he was raping me and all those emotions really caught up with me.

"Hey guys. I was diagnosed earlier this year with ADHD primarily inattentive and was prescribed METHYLPHENIDATE ER 27 MG. I've been taking it every work day so Monday - Friday and occasional weekends for the past six months. At first, it was night and day. The first 2- 3 months were euphoric for me. I've suffered severe depression and anxiety my entire life and it's culminated in chronic executive dysfunction. I never felt physically tired just mentally tired and it made it really hard to sleep or when I did sleep it made it hard to wake up. But after being medicated I found myself energized. I was able to start and complete tasks. I began to not only do well at my job but excel. It was life- changing for me. However, in August, a couple of months after I began the medication, I fell down the stairs and injured my knee. This kicked off a domino effect of other minor illnesses and skyrocketed my stress which in turn amplified my depression. After a four- day hospital stay and some at home recovery, I was finally doing better in September and a lot of the old energy came back that I'd seen in previous months. But as October wrapped up I noticed a sharp decline in my ability to focus. By the end of November, I felt worse than I did before my diagnosis and subsequent medication. Now I've reached a point where my anxiety is nearing its peak, my depression is awful but also weirdly stunted, almost like I'm tunnel focused on a void. I'm normally a ""coping by way of suicidal ideation""depressive but can't even foster the energy to imagine that. I don't know what's happening but my work and social life are already being terribly affected. I don't know what's happening. I'm scared and frustrated and confused.

"Prestory I am 20 years old and about one year ago, I was more happy than ever before. I met a girl which i immediatly fell in love with. I only had to bear one more year of school and could finally begin my preparations for my dream job. I felt like i could handle anything. But one day, about half a year later, i started to doubt everything. At that point i realized that i have to leave everything and everyone behind to pursue my dream. And the day came close when i had to move away from home, from all my friends and from my love. So i decided to abort all connections to them to ""already get in touch""with being alone. After a month i couldn't bear it anymore. I became depressed and had to get in contact, at least with my love, again. To my luck she was very cool with it, even though i hurt her with just leaving. And i had a great last month with her. And then it really began to go downwards. I moved out of my parents house, alone in a small flat. In an area in which i dont know anything or anyone. And far away for anybody to ever visit me. I stayed in contact with one friend and my love, but soon the lonelyness began to really screw me. At that point i thought i would never be with my love again, and i was okay with it. Or at least i thought so. But then she told me she has a boyfriend. It was always a back and forth with my hope fore ever getting together with her until that point. Sometimes because she gave me the hope and sometimes because i misinterpreted her. I just couldn't hold it back anymore. The last part is already three months in the past and i still haven't recovered. I try to kill the pain with alcohol as often as i can. But i dont drink when i have to go to work the next day. I think because i still want to fulfill my dream. And i spend most time of the day thinking of how to kill myself. I know that i am still a few steps away from actually doing it, because i still have hope it could get better. But i just can't find a way how to get out of my black hole.

I couldnt see the text because I was working with my manager and I explained that to her. But she went off and told me that she wants to date other guys and be single. And also that she hates being with me. What should I do? Is this normal for someone with anxiety to say? She told me that I have to be strong and less sensitive when I get hurt from her comments.

"So I started 10 mg adderall twice a day about a month ago. It went really well for the first couple weeks Ive been organized, able to plan and follow through, and the day feels slower but in a good way etc but recently Ive been feeling everything kind of come to a grinding halt. My symptoms seem to be returning and the side effects of the adderall have essentially disappeared. At my most regulated post euphoria pre this nightmare I was keeping a straight room, doing things immediately instead of waiting and forgetting until hours or days later, my mind fog was clearing, and my stress levels hot record lows even helping with my social phobia when attending job interviews. But yesterday for example, I experienced my old symptoms in a way that was shockingly magnified by my new clarity. What I mean is that before I took adderall I had no idea how much of my issues, sensitivity, and bad ""traits""came down to adhd. The worst of which was my impulsivity. I couldn't shut myself up in front of my little brother, mother, and two friends. I was saying something that all at once managed to embarrass my little brother, piss of my mom, and make everyone involved - friends especially- terribly uncomfortable. It was just the kind of thing no one wants to hear about and shouldnt be discussed and there was a bit of my brain telling me all of that but my mouth wanted to finish. So they compromised by apologizing instantly after I finished what I was saying and let out an awkward laugh to seal the deal. Great work guys. The teams back together again. And after that awkward interchange I found my random veering thoughts popping out of my mouth throughout regular conversation. And then when my friends would return to the original topic instead of acknowledge my monologue about how its weird that anyone would want to be a guitarist over a pianist because guitars hurt your fingers and pianos don't I felt embarrassed and upset and for a moment angry that they were ignoring me. Even though we werent in any way talking about guitars or pianos. I had literally interrupted a regular conversation to bring that up. Its been lots of things but this was the one thing I knew I couldnt chalk up to me placebo effecting myself into thinking the drugs had stopped working. Because it was impulsive and unexpected and hurt my feelings a bit. So my question at the end of this is is it normal for a dose to work well for you for a couple weeks and then taper off into uselessness? Does that mean I need a higher dose or am I missing something? Also the side effect thing I meant to mention, I used to consistently get headaches and tired eyes as apart of my comedown from adderall, like almost 4 hours on the dot each time. So thats another thing it never worked longer than 4 hours for me so I was planning on asking for 10 mg 3x a day but now it seems theres a new issue",new meds worked for first half of the month but my impulsivity and innattentivity and sensitivity have spiked recently . If a dose works for a bit and then stops suddenly does that mean I need a higher does or is there some other explanation ?,"I had an impulsive outburst in front of my family, friends, and little brother that made everyone uncomfortable.

"I feel this on a personal level. Im usually extremely punctual, and Im able to do this because I put my schoolwork ahead of everything most notably sleep and am terrified of what happens if I turn something in late. A few days ago, it was 2am and I still had to do 2 hours worth of writing, 30 mins of turning stuff in, and 20 mins of getting ready for bed. If I did the writing, it wouldve been probably around 5am that I went to bed. Sleep is really important to my mental health and functioning so that just wasnt an option. I had to email my teacher and tell him I needed an extra day. This teacher loves me. He will take any opportunity to show me off. And Im proud of how well I do in that class.

"I can't help but wonder if the person who wrote this is actually as interesting as they think they are. We all perceive the world from our own perspectives and are inherently biased to view ourselves favorably for most people so when we stack ourselves up against others we tend to do pretty well. Whether or not that's reflective of reality is a whole different question entirely. This philosophy seems to make for a lolsorandumb edgelord rather than a genuinely complete and interesting person. A lot of the stuff that makes you ""interesting""comes from enduring hardships, exploring interesting parts of the world, and participating in experiences that are moving and life changing. The ""fuck it""approach might lead to fun bar nights or a cool camping trip, but is that really all you think you need to be an interesting person?",seems to me like the person who wrote this has a very ' basic bitch ' approach to what is interesting .,I don't think the person who wrote this is as interesting as they think they are and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.,I'm not sure if I'm actually as interesting as I think I am or if this is just how I view myself.,I don't think the person who wrote this is actually as interesting as they think they are and I'm not sure if that's a good enough reason to be an interesting person.,0.3404255319148936,0.17777777777777776,0.2978723404255319,0.13953488372093023,0.0,0.0930232558139535,0.3333333333333333,0.15384615384615383,0.2962962962962963
"I have the same issues I am working through. For me I think it is a desire to be noticed or liked coupled with being ashamed of myself. I want validation. I also think that it is important what other people think, loved ones, professionals, it is just not important what you think they think. The problem comes from making assumptions of their opinions based on your negative bias towards yourself and then automatically assuming that your conclusions are true. Some other things do not have an imagined audience in your head of the people you want to impress and their judgement, which is really your judgement. Do not see yourself in your mind's eye either. Really, it is all about removing your ego, living in the present, being aware of what is actually happening around you, having a curiosity, not living in a fractured past or any one of your futures.

"Hi guys, I've been up all night liking old posts on facebook and I thought I might as well post something on here. It's 5am right now and I feel like I could run a marathon.

"Hear me out. A few years ago, I became really suicidal, and just sort of gave up on everything. It was 8th grade, and my last year of middle school, but it was the year my teachers decided to bombard us with a crap ton of homework everyday to prepare us for high school. That was the single most productive year of my life so far. I got an honor roll that year as in I had a high average of grades . I never went and got help for my depression or suicidal thoughts, but I suppose that's a story for another time. It was like, having a date where my life ends was pushing me to do the best I could, to leave a good impression of me on my classmates, teachers, friends, and family. Mind you, I was still productive after that near suicide attempt, i had other reasons I guess, or maybe I was just grateful to be alive then, but now its like I have no energy. I have no urge to do what needs to be done, assignments, studying for tests, talking to people about this. I have fallen behind on everything, its my last year in high school and I'm fucking it up grandly. I am getting Cs and Bs when I used to be an A student. I know 12th grade is just hard and I shouldn't expect to just be an A student, but everything went downhill last year, when my grandfather passed away.

"Hey r Anxiety. So I have a job interview tomorrow. I graduated a few years ago and have been doing odd jobs ever since.

However, this was not the only instance where I have had trouble with work. Holding a job has ALWAYS been an issue with me since my first job at 16.

I am nervous for the interview, but I am even more nervous that I will get an offer. I recently turned down a position about 2 months ago and feel I need to strike while things are hot. However, my biggest fear is I will be offered the job and have to turn it down. As I keep getting further my graduation date, it just feels like a must have. And thats not to mention how my parents would take it they may accelerate the process of kicking me out! Any ideas on how to approach tomorrows interview?

"That's why it is a great idea to enlighten people on your mental illness without also trying to crucify them. They will care about you respect you more and be more inclined to actually learn about your issue and even modify their behavior to accomodate you. This just won't happen if you go around demanding, expecting and crying wolf constantly. That's why I completely reject this mindset, behavior and clear impulse of mental illness getting out of hand. All this behavior does is feed negative mindsets on mental health. Victimhood culture does not help. What also sucks is people using a meme related to Autism to bag out Neurotypicals. If you have to resort to insinuations of ""Reee""to make any form of point you're just clueless yourself. There's nothing accpetable about implying Neurotypicals are so socially unaware of mental illness issues that they're Reee Autistic levels of bad. My opinion and point still stands. I have OCD and completely reject assumptions of ""Neurotypicals, ""that this meme implies. It isn't fair, logical, reasonable or serving of the OCD community.

"Back when I was in middle school and most of highschool , I thought that I was good at math. I'm pretty sure me going to KUMON for a good chunk of my childhood might've had something to do with it. Up until my last year of high school, Math was the only subject that I didn't mess up on for a long time for the most part . When I took calculus in my last year of highschool, I'm not exactly sure what happened. I started getting terrible grades. Could be that I was going through a somewhat dark time in my life or that the teacher was more strict that time idk. By the end of it, I came out with a 64 and had to take it again the next fall since I was rejected from university. Once I finally got to university the year after, My math was mostly tolerable barring a couple of really good moments up until I started online classes.

"Ok let me start off by saying this. I'm 17 going through high school. I've been dating the same girl for the past year, and ive known her for about a year longer than that. I don't have BPD, and I'm fairly convinced maybe she doesn't either. Back 1 year before she started middle school her parents divorced, and it was hard on her. She felt isolated because her parents werent together and she had trouble adjusting to the school where her mom lived because she had zero friends since she moved. Naturally, like any kid in the 21st century she made internet friends, and she wound up talking with a girl in ohio who ive met and she's a pretty nice person aside from her schizophrenia ask me about that, I've got stories . Anyways a shy girl just staring middle school who only has friends made online. Eventually she makes more friends, and goes through middle school as a normal girl, very happy go lucky and free until 8th grade. She finds out shes going to have to leave her friends up north and move down south and start again in high school with nobody she knows. This is where the suicide attempt happens. The emotional teenager got in trouble for something petty, and her father cuts off her internet access for a week. Shes moved into a new high school, lonely, only friends on the internet and now she can't talk to them? Internet drama happens and right in the middle of it she gets in trouble and now cant talk to them. Well depression and isolation kick in for her and she attempts suicide because of all the self doubt and hate she has for herself. Her dad catches her in the act and she gets shipped off to a mental institution, there shes diagnosed with BPD. Now heres where it gets a little confusing. She takes these drugs they give her, and her symptoms get worse and worse, her insomnia spikes and now she goes days without sleep living life in her freshman year. Oh and she's transgender now. Her depression and sleep get worse and worse, her mixed emotions intensify, her feeling of self worth is at an all time low. Then she stops taking her medication behind her parents backs and picks up the alcohol they store. Her sleep issues stay, but hey her mood is getting better. A few months later, shes not trans anymore, back to female, she meets me, she puts down the bottle. One year later, shes free of depression, sleeping issues, and she now has a 3.8 GPA, and she omits virtually no signs of manic depression. Recently we were going through her room and I was helping her clean. I found her stash of old pill bottles from medication she used to take. I looked up the side effects for all these medications, all of them. Literally all of them have depression and insomnia as a side effect. I'm inclined to believe she was falsly diagnosed, and the medication gave her symptoms which made her seem exactly like she had BPD.

"Chronic emptiness. It's a symptom of BPD And since we have BPD, we can expect to feel that way. It helps to get this point out the way because it validates your question and concern. Secondly I'm too fucked to be on Reddit Thirdly I forgot my point Oh yeah, basically I realised I need people in my life. Dealing with chronic emptiness feels like an impossible battle, instead of rather find ways to keep social. Only came to that conclusion not long ago though. It does help because I have more options for being social. Yes I'll feel sad and lonely, especially when I was away from my ex- FP but I always plenty more than just their company.

"Hi all! For some background- I was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type as well as depression and anxiety when I was 16 and am now about to turn 21. I have also been struggling with anorexia on and off since I was 13. While I was in high school still, I was unmedicated the majority of the time because my parents didn't support the use of psychiatric drugs. The last few months of my senior year I began using Vyvanse and found it incredibly helpful. It was incredibly beneficial with getting tasks done and managing my mood swings. Unfortunately I was in the middle of a relapse with my anorexia at this time though my psychiatrist and therapist didn't know of my history at all with disordered eating which is why I was prescribed Vyvanse . In August 2018 I entered a treatment center for my eating disorder and my psychiatrist took me off Vyvanse because of the appetite surpassing nature of stimulants and I haven't had it since. I was prescribed Strattera and have slowly increased my dosage over the 2 years and am currently on 80mg. I find the Strattera helpful overall but not even remotely similar and I still have an incredibly difficult time getting mundane tasks done. I've approached the topic of beginning a stimulant again with my therapist and dietitian but not my psychiatrist. We are all very concerned about the appetite suppression causing a relapse despite me being fairly stable right now. So, has anyone had success with managing their ADHD and an eating disorder at the same time? Any general advice to give? I'm really struggling with managing the treatment of both disorders at the same time, as well as other comorbid disorders especially during a pandemic",I suffer from anorexia and ADHD though am currently stable with my eating disorder and am struggling to treat both disorders at the same time .

Yesterday, a man followed me with his car and asked me to get in. Its something Im used to living in the city, Im probably about a 4 or 5 when it comes to attractiveness and the men who do this probably only see me as a walking vagina. But this time I had genuinely feared that this man would take me, I texted my fianc and he didnt answer till I got back. I felt let down but suddenly, I found myself not really caring about my life. I went to sleep at 6pm and pretty much slept until 8am this morning. I dont care about anything. I have suspicions about my fianc having some thoughts of cheating but I dont find myself hurt. I dont feel like a mother. When I think about dying I imagine the nothingness Id feel. I know if I tell anyone Id get the typical dont die people care think about your family but I dont care.

"Yeah, I totally get that. I catch myself doing that occasionally still. I work with my therapist on identifying one of these things each week and creatively problem- solving it. Last week I tackled the perpetual laundry nightmare everyone with ADHD seems to have. So whenever it popped into my head, I daydreamed about what my perfect, simple, easy laundry setup would be that would actually get me to put clothes away. Here's an example of puzzle- solving that you can ignore if you want Each week my bf and I do our laundry at his parents' place bc they bribe us to hang out with them with free laundry and food, and it makes them feel better if we accept, lol . We usually manage to wash and dry everything, fold it, and put it in a tub. Then we bring it home at like 2am and it sits in the tub in the living room all week while we drive ourselves crazy trying to find clothes. Then we fill a different tub or laundry bag, or cardboard box with dirty laundry which is everywhere, but mostly at the foot of our bed the next week because there are still clean clothes in our laundry tub. Repeat indefinitely, and clean clothes are folded, covered in cat hair, and sitting in various containers all over the house. Why do I do this bullshit? I'm 29 for godsake! Because the time I ""should""put it away is right when we get home, but I'm tired, my meds have worn off, and there are too many steps. And there is no other cue during the week that tells me it's time to do it, so I can always ""do it later""ha! . What I can't or know I won't do Berate myself into putting it away at 2am. Put it away the next morning. Take our clothes to a laundromat. Do laundry and get home earlier. Get rid of clothing. Anything that adds steps outside of the laundry process that happens at the parents' house. Side note sorting clothes, opening dresser drawers, putting clothes in, and closing drawers is too many steps. Hanging anything is too many steps. Also, any kind of ""putting things away""that is secretly code for ""hiding things""in drawers, in closets, etc. usually leads to me forgetting things exist and never using them again. What I can and am willing to do Hyperfocus on as many laundry steps as I want, as long they happen during ""laundry time""at the parents' house because that lets me procrastinate going home and going to bed . Also, anything that feels like 1 easy step and takes 1 minute or less when we get home at 2am, as long as it happens on the way to me crashing in my bed. My tentative solution I got a bunch of collapsible fabric boxes the kind designed for those square shelf thingies . I got rid of my dresser and colonized an extra bookshelf that had been sitting unused upstairs. We take the boxes and dirty clothes to ""laundry time, ""and as they dry we fold and sort them into the boxes pants in this one, shirts in this one, etc. , edges facing up so I can see all of them and never have to dig through to find something. We pack the boxes into the laundry tub, with my fav pajamas on the bottom underneath, and take it home. Essentially, I bought myself portable ""drawers""so that the ""put clothes in drawers""step can happen there instead of at home . When we get home, I carry the tub inside, and instead of putting it down in the living room, I just take it with me upstairs. Same number of steps, just rearranged. I can't wear my pj's unless the boxes are out of the way, so they might as well go one the shelves, with no expectation of which box goes where. Who cares, they all go on the shelves, tipped sideways so I can see what's in them. The laundry tub stays there, throwing distance from our bed. I change into my pj's, tossing my clothes into the tub jumpshot! . My pj's live the rest of the week on the floor next to my bed, but my clothes consistently get thrown into the tub. Next week when we do our usual dirty- clothes collecting, I empty any remaining clean clothes from the boxes onto the shelves and stash the boxes collapsed in the laundry tub. As far as hanging stuff up? Fuck that noise. If it can't be folded and shoved in a box, or draped over the top of the clean laundry and then thrown hanging off the corner of the bookshelf, I'm getting rid of it. I never wear that shit anyway because those button- downs always end up wrinkled clean on my floor","Fuck dressers . Fuck closets . Fuck clothes that have to be hung up . Fuck ""putting stuff away ""by hiding everything . Take advantage of hyperfocus as much as possible before it gets interrupted by a drive home . Turn putting clothes away into a method of procrastinating , because I 'm really good at procrastinating . Put obstacles in the way of my favorite things that can only be removed by doing the thing .

"I'm a first time poster, I only just subscribed here. This might be a long post, let me know if there's anything that I need to fix. I've been smoking since I was 16, I'm 20 now and in college. About 7 months ago I met my girlfriend whom I absolutely adore. However, she was never into weed. It was hard at first, but she never pressured me to quit. I started anti- depressants and she said I needed to quit so I could feel how I felt on the meds. I did for a month and I got back on the stuff since I felt I could now handle my meds. Honestly they paired fine, but the problem was that now I was covering it up and lying about it. I came clean last night. It was rough. I had lied to her for months and she even had suspicions and gave me chances to come clean, but I never did. I obliterated her trust. Thankfully she is the most beautiful soul, and has given me a chance to finally, finally be clean. I know it's a long post, and a long road to recovery. Idk what more info I should give, I guess I smoked pretty daily for about 4 years with many people in my life doing the same so it'll be a challenge to stay clean near my friends and family's influence.

"My own experience with CBT is more related to anxiety than bipolar, but I can tell you this it really, really works.

"Hello everyone, thank you for spending a few minutes to read this, Ill try to make it as short as I can, but I may get a bit ranty at times, so apologies in advance lol. Im 26F and Ive struggled with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Because of it, Ive made few friends growing up, and because of some relationship drama a couple years ago, have thus lost all of my friends, pretty much. A couple years ago, I was dating a friend from my friend group. He was narcissistic, entitled, spoiled, and constantly manipulated me to think that I had no place with my friends, and everything I did with them caused him to get jealous or bothered. This and his pretty negative nature led me to leave him, but as I figured, it meant that all of my friends went with him. They had all been friends since elementary middle school, so they would just naturally take his side first. So its so frustrating when you know someone else is controlling the narrative when you have no way to back yourself up. I ended up getting with my current partner a little after leaving, and I knew that all of the details of my social life would just spur up more drama with my ex and my friends, so I just accepted that I was pushed out from their group permanently. I would say that I had a few of the friends who I was closer with, and only one of them has kept in occasional contact with me, but also randomly ghosts me out of nowhere, which gets my anxiety rolling into what did I do? Hes hanging out with the rest of them and just went through some tough stuff that I was talking him throughthey all follow me on social media, but dont actually interact with me. It makes the whole thing feel sounsure. I feel like just cutting them off and moving on is right, but I also miss my friends so much At this point its just frustratingfor my partner. I feel so bad because he is my only outlet, but he also blames himself a lot for me losing my friends when this is not the case whatsoever . I simply lost them because I couldnt act sooner to explain myself. I couldnt be the stronger voice against my ex. My partner and my son are everything to me, so Im not diminishing their value at all, but I feel that I cant properly get my anxiety to go away. Im writing a story with elements drawn from my experience to help cope with my feelings, but it doesnt feel like enough until I finish publish it. I was going to rant all of this to the friend previously mentioned above since he knows all the specifics and context better , but he recently just hit me up then ghosted my completely to go LAN with all of the friends. I guess I am just wondering how to cope with things like sadness about losing friends when you cant really talk to your one outlet about itor any friends lmao. The feeling comes in waves, and it just really bums me out randomly and I dont have any way to release it. I dont feel alonebut I feel unheard and ignored","I lost my friends to a relationship ending a couple years ago , and ca nt talk to my partner about it because he blames himself for it happening when it s not his fault and have told him many times .

". I went through something similar to your brother, lost my dad 6 weeks before my college graduation which he told me was the only thing he wanted to live long enough to see he was chronically ill and I was the only one of his 3 children he didn't bother going to the high school graduation for . A switch sort of flipped in me and I was angry and upset about every little thing, reasonable or unreasonable. I finally realized I needed help when I was unreasonably angry for three days over a relatively minor event and could barely sleep more than a few hours. Prior to this, people always told me I was the calmest, most patient person they ever met and I don't think I'd ever raised my voice in anger before. My usual ways of calming myself down stopped working watching old cartoons, playing video games, and writing stories . What finally worked for me was I did something about one of the biggest problems that was bothering me the one that was bothering me for 3 days by finding the best nonviolent solution I could. Then I straight up refused to act on any of my anger. It was hard at first, but if I had a problem, I'd walk away from it, think about it, and try and come up with a situation that didn't involve accusing anyone of anything but did address the problem, and I accepted situations where the battle wasn't worth the trouble. Then I made sure that I was busy with things I wanted to do and that interested me but didn't include a lot of people, so I didn't have as much empty time to think about things that were anger inducing. Took me 6 months to realize I had a problem but only a week or so to fix it. I feel like anger is almost like a drug - you get addicted to the feeling of it, feel super self righteous even if you know you are being stupid you can't imagine giving in or letting things go , and the more you let yourself do it the easier it gets to be in that state of mind and escalate the behavior to worse levels. If you always yell and scream, that will be your default reaction. So what I did was like going cold turkey, so to speak. Eventually I got myself back to the point where my default was to make a joke and laugh the situation off or make people feel like it's no big deal if they made a mistake. I think the most important thing is that your husband needs to realize and accept that he has an anger problem, and that change needs to come from within. No one can make him feel not angry except himself at the end of the day. Of course therapy might help, but he still has to actually try to do things the counselors tell him. Convincing someone they have an anger management problem is very difficult to do. It might also be worth looking into grief counseling or support groups, though, and I remember reading a study that said 40 of males with depression are undiagnosed because they express it as anger. Just don't put yourself in a position where you might be in danger, and make sure you draw lines that he knows he's not allowed to cross e.g. swearing at you specifically, hitting you, screaming at your friends or others you care about, etc. . If he does cross a line, make sure there is a consequence for doing so writing an apology letter, you staying at a friend's house for the night, etc. . Otherwise, in my experience, lines will be crossed far more frequently and the behavior will continue to escalate. Just keep in mind that these are things that helped me personally and there are many anger management techniques out there, some people respond to them differently","He needs to want to change , refuse to act on his anger by yelling , screaming , and constantly reliving every bad thing that 's happened that day , and think of reasonable solutions to any problems he has . Keeping busy helps . You need to make sure you draw lines about things that are n't okay from him and stick with them . Therapy could help , but only if he wants to change and realizes it 's a problem .","Don't put him in a position where he's in danger, don't let him cross the line, and make sure he knows there's a consequence if he crosses it. It's hard to convince someone they have an anger problem, but it's also hard to get them to accept that they have one, and that change needs to come from within.","Don't be afraid to talk to him about it, but don't put yourself in a position where you're afraid he 'll cross a line. If he does, make sure he knows he's not allowed to cross that line, and make sure there is a consequence for his behavior if he does.","Don't yell and scream, find a nonviolent solution to the problem, don't put yourself in dangerous situations, make sure he knows he's not allowed to cross any lines, and give him consequences if he does cross them.

"I feel a breakdown coming on, a proper one. One by one, things have slowly been messing up for me recently, and its just brought my depression crashing back down upon me. Nothing is enjoyable anymore, and I'm struggling to find the motivation to do any of my college work - this is the most important year for me, and I can't even be bothered. I press on though, I do it anyway. A single piece of work that should usually take me 30 minutes, is now taking three nights to complete, I just zone out, and then get so angry with myself for not being mentally stable right now. Its not just work, I'm ignoring the people who mean the most to me, and feel them slipping away too. I've got so many worries and debts that I'm just ignoring. I've always been like this, when I'm feeling my worst, I just push forward, and struggle through all of the pain until it either goes away, or until I'm just so numb to it, this is like a messed up coping strategy for me. It isnt working anymore. This is the lowest that I've ever sunk, and I can feel it progressively getting worse and worse as new problems pile on top of me. I've never properly broken down before, because I've never let myself. I feel like that might not be an option though. I just need some time away from everything, from my work, and environment. From my problems from the memories of her. I feel so close to just snapping, shouting at everyone around me and ignoring all my responsibilities because I seriously cannot handle them though. However, theres a logical part of my brain that tells me how stupid that would be it would only hurt me in the long run. I'm just scared that if it dosnt happen now, It will be so much worse when it does. If you've made it this far, thank you. I'll answer any questions, and reply to whatever I can.

Okay so I made the decision to quick smoking weed about a week ago. At first I planned on stopping on December 31st going into the new year. But I have changed my mind and I'm going to start as soon as the batch I have runs out which will be today or tomorrow. Anyway I brought this up to my friends and they all gave me the same response saying I could never quit because I smoke every day and that I'm a Pu for wanting to quit. I tried to explain my reasons but they didn't care to listen. The advice I'm seeking is what I should do about this. All of my friends smoke and that's all we do when we hang out. None of them are supportitive of me quitting. I know if I'm hanging around them Ill be triggered to smoke again. I'm not sure what to do because I don't want to not hangout with them just because they're using. Also I'm quitting with no support which I feel will be very difficult. I feel like I'm going to end up smoking again and never fully being able to quit,"I 'm quitting smoking , my friends are n't supportive , I feel I 'll just relapse and never fully quit .",My friends aren't supportive of me quitting and I'm going to start smoking as soon as the last batch of weed runs out.

"My boyfriend has been in my life for 7 years. Several years ago, we dated for over a year. He had to move out of the country at one point, our dating relationship ended, and we lost contact for a while after a couple years. When he moved back to the country, we began talking again and it wan an immediate connection again, and we were back together. That was around 2 years ago. I know that if I want to be with anyone forever, it is him. He knew me when I was younger, we grew up together, we went through some tough real life shit together back in the day as well as recently. He has always been good to me and I know he really loves me. I love him more now than i did when we were younger, and he is true. T best friend. Our values are the same, our long term goals are the same. He is good for me and I have had to force myself to change into a better person to even feel worthy of him. I have a lot of issues and he sticks by me through it all. Every day, I realize how much I seriously lucked out being with him. I have this dedicated, patient, intelligent, handsome man who loves me and has loved me for years, not to sound corny, but through good times and bad he has loved me. I don't want to wreck this and throw it away. I don't want to lose him. I think it sounds a little like bragging now, which I'm not trying to do, but the issue comes in when I consider my insecurities. Every day, my dreamy thoughts of our future together get crushed down by thoughts of betrayal and inevitable pain that he ""will bring to me"". I feel like this dream has to be a lie. He isn't perfect, but over all he's pretty perfect for me. He has lied to me once about 6- 7 months ago and it broke me in a way I didn't think could happen. A ""normal person""could probably forgive and get over it, but i have struggled for the better part of this year to stop thinking about this mistake every day. No matter how genuine his apology or how many times he really listens to me cry and he tells me he's sorry. Other than that lie which I truly don't want to get into here our relationship is ideal. I have made the common BPD psycho mistakes but I am still someone he wants to be with. We have talked about marriage. We both know that if we were to get married to anyone it would be each other. I don't want a wedding, so it's not the thought of the wedding itself I am attached to or anything like that. I want to to be married to him so I can stop thinking of breaking up every day. I also want to be married to him so we can be together forever, no question about it. I realize I sound fucking nuts in this post but I think someone here might understand me. Does anyone relate to this and have any advice?","My boyfriend is a good dude . I am insecure and nuts .

"Main backstory is that I got diagnosed in 4th grade, we tried several meds before deciding on adderall xr, and my parents have had me retested every 3 years for adhd up until i was 18 and I've always gotten a positive diagnosis. Fast forward to freshman year of college and I wanted to see if I could make it without medication. Everything went downhill real quick and I ended up getting kicked out twice due to academic reasons. After 2 years off, I'm going to be taking classes again in the fall. My dilemma is that I live in a college town and everyone is obviously very stingy with this medication. I've been to four separate doctors, since I needed to get a new doctor anyway, and they all say the same thing ""six months with a therapist or psychaitrist and get retested"". My old doctor isn't willing to write a script since I'm now 22 and I have aged out of her office.

"I 24 F recently started seeing a therapist again in September after years of going without one. I am no stranger to counseling as I started when I was about 4 or 5. The last time I saw a therapist was probably 2012 or 2013 and I just went back to my childhood psychiatrist. This year I found one doctor and went to a few appointments before realizing she was NOT for me. So I just cancelled my next appointment and never went back. Easy. Then I started doing online therapy video chat . I really thought I enjoyed this person but the past few appointments have been very disappointing. She cant stay on topic, has taken a very long time to fax a referral for a psychiatrist, is almost always late, seems to be somewhat judgmental or at- least makes me feel like it . Ive been trucking through but tonight I have an appointment and I am dreading it. The last three or four sessions we discussed literally nothing. I even got frustrated and very annoyed last time because more than half of the appointment she spent looking for my referral letter on her computer. Im obviously shy to speak up and afraid of confrontation hello anxiety which is why I am turning here. I dont know how to say this isnt working out and obviously in person I would probably just ghostbut I feel like thats not an easy option since we text and have a standing appointment time.

"To give you some background, I am a 19 year old male, currently in college. My dad has always been against me getting tested because he isn't a believer in the disease and is highly against any form of prescribed pill. He has had neck surgery twice, and refused to take any type of painkiller prescribed to him. I have a few short questions for other people diagnosed later in life with ADHD ADD.

How do I open the conversation, and be taken seriously with people who doubt? I have had suspicions myself about having ADHD, but have never been medically tested. My girlfriend is the one who suggested it to me because she has noticed symptoms in our 14 months together. She has mentioned it 4- 5 times throughout that period. My mother has also noticed me not being able to focus, and just catching me with little things leading her also to believe I have ADD ADHD.

"I need help understanding what I'm feeling. I tried to tell my best friend, but he failed to understand it. I don't know if he'll be able to put in any more effort, but I really need somebody to help me get what's going on. I've never been this desperate. I wish he would've seen my desperation and put in a little more effort to help me figure this out. On Tuesday, my counselor was concerned that I had a problem accepting it's okay to be hurt. So he told me that next time I was hurting, to tell myself to accept it and realize that it's fine. So I tried that today, and when I tried to accept it, I discovered something. I have had this constant pain in my heart. It's almost physical right at the bottom. I couldn't identify where the pain was coming from until now. When I tried to accept that being hurt is okay, I got a glimpse of the pain. It was my hurt, but it was also everything else that's wrong with me. I hate myself, think I'm a terrible, unskillful person who has no future anywhere. I think I'm a really bad person. I believe what happened is that I tried fighting these feelings of self- loathing and self- pity using logic in the past, but it just suppressed the feelings and kept pushing them deeper inside. This eventually turned into the pain. Whenever somebody else told me I was a good person, I tried to believe them but the feelings of being worthless kept adding to the pain. So consciously I might have believed them, but subconsciously I still think I'm worthless. One possibility is that I felt like I was lying to myself when I tried convincing myself I wasn't so bad, and that turned the self- loathing into guilt. I'm not sure exactly what happened. Now I have two options, I can either accept the hurt, but along with it accept I'm a terrible person and can't ever do anything, in which case I can't improve my life at all. The alternative is that I keep fighting the feelings of self- loathing and self- pity, which will cause the pain inside to keep growing, and keep me in depression. The alternative doesn't help me improve my life either. Does anybody understand what I'm saying? I'm worried and I need some insight into this. I don't feel like I can win in this situation","I think subconsciously I believe I 'm a terrible person . Whenever I fight it or somebody tells me I 'm not , I try to believe them .

"Hey bro sis I had a slightly different past than you, but right now I'm in my second year of college. I shut my parents out for most of my life and abused substances to because it was easier than being ADHD. A couple of therapists have suggested SPD or Executive Functioning Disorder. I'm supposed to be paying attention in lecture right now but I know I can just take notes from the book later lol. But, my parents had all kinds of signs before and I was left a little weird feeling like they had never tried to figure it out. Like my teachers would always tell them that I was disruptive, that I blurted things out without raising my hand. I always told them I wanted friends to play with at recess because everyone always told me I was annoying or told me to shut up all the time. But recently I told them about what had been happening with me. Because I was tired of being high or drunk or whatever. Now that we have an understanding together about what may be going on, I had therapy this summer, it's been 2 months since I've smoked weed.

"I don't know how to get on with my life. I'm in my final year of college and my grades are abysmal. It's been just over a year since I've been diagnosed. I have no one to talk to about this, my friends don't wholly believe that I have ADHD because in their eyes I function ""normally"". They have this really odd paradigm about ADHD and think like it's some learning or something. My parents are also in denial about the whole thing. But I know they all mean well. My school days were sort of fine. The only thing I really used to get into trouble was incomplete written classwork and non submission of homework and assignments. Over the years I learnt to how to evade the wrath of teachers with different tricks and we weren't really graded on those so it didn't really matter. However I could never really pay attention in class either. After a while I used to become really agitated, this was easily solved by pulling some pranks and class and playing the fool. There were quite a few people who'd join in and even the teachers were really nice and could take a joke. My test scores were average at that point, I had relatively good logical reasoning and memory so even with minimal effort I could manage to maintain an average score in tests, but I could never push past this average however motivated I got to perform. During this time my parents had me enrolled used to enroll me for various classes and coaching, from Keyboard to Basketball all of which I dropped after a while. Then came my first big exam, and I managed to study a little bit more. This was a big final exam so two years of the school syllabus lead up to this and we had a 2 months long break to prepare and during this time I studied a bit more and managed to score well above average. This would lead to everyone thinking that I was just a lazy kid who didn't like to write. And after this my antics continued except now my teachers didn't appreciate me playing games and fooling around in class, this led to me getting into trouble more often. However it still wasn't too bad as now we had these ""objective""type tests in which I would perform pretty good, so good in fact that my marks would be in the top 3 of the class. This was because these questions were all really tricky multiple choice questions and with some logical deduction I could crack them, but my regular subjective papers started going downhill from here. Here is where the turbulence in my life began, these objective type papers were preparation for college entrance exams and these are a big deal in my country. My parents expected me to study vigorously during this time in order to get into a good college. I however couldn't live upto these expectations, this led to a lot of fights in the house because I was in my rebellious phase as well and my dad has anger management issues. I just had to pretend as though I was studying a lot for an entire year, a pretty horrible year. I still managed to do decently in my entrance exam and got a pretty good engineering college. Everything went downhill from the start of my engineering course. Now assignments and routine tests which required a lot of writing all contributed to my grades and I could not cope at all. And on top of it classes were much more serious and my friends in class really wanted to learn during that time, while it was really difficult for me to sit through an entire lecture. My grades for in my first three semesters were really horrible. However I'm a really carefree and happy go lucky person and didn't let this pull me down. However in 4th semester I felt like my life was going nowhere and started feeling slightly depressed. It was at this point that I visited a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed non stimulant medications Atomoxetine . My parents weren't too happy with me being on medication and took me to get a second opinion where also I was prescribed the same medication. The meds helped a bit in the beginning but they used to make me feel drowsy and I'd forget to take them routinely and thus never experienced the full effects of it. But after this I got into fitness and greatly improved my overall mood and is the only thing that's stuck with me so far. I tried doing projects to improve my profile which I'd forget about, I tried doing online courses which I'd drop in a week And now it's my final year and my GPA isn't good enough to sit for many companies that come for campus recruitment, and I'm struggling to prepare for the ones I'm eligible for. All the while attending classes which is still a nightmare for me, and in addition to all this I still get yelled at home for being forgetful and procrastinating. I feel like all this is edging me towards depression again","Nobody fully understands the troubles I go through with ADHD , and I have no one to talk to about it , so I thought I 'd just vent my feelings on Reddit Took me over three hours over one week of procrastinating to type this entire post , I know most of you wo n't be able to read such a long post , but whoever does , thank you , it means a lot","I'm in my final year of college and my grades are abysmal.

"Okay, first off I wasn't really sure where to post this, so sorry if I picked a bad subreddit. Basically as I said, in my public speaking class we are supposed to give an introductory speech where we bring in an object and use it to help describe ourselves, like a journalist might bring in a newspaper. Since I can remember I have had a love hate relationship with drawing for the record, I am majoring in a different field, for various reasons . I'm a pretty flaky person and art is one of the few things that has always mattered to me. So the idea is I take in a pen pencil and use that as my prop, and talk about how I have always loved drawing and expressing myself creatively etc. This would be easy and safe, but it feels so false because for me, art has also been closely intertwined with the anxiety and depression that I have been battling on and off for years. I feel the compulsion to include that in those moments where I can't bring myself to draw, the pencil is a representation of my fear that I'll fail, my fear that people will reject my art and by extension, reject me. The pencil is both sides of the coin - expression and withdrawl, creative flow and anxiety. The pencil represents me because it reminds me of both ends of the spectrum. I'm afraid that this will come off all angsty and be off- putting and everyone will hate me forever etc. etc. y'all know how it is but it feels like the only way to honestly approach the subject, and I hate to be dishonest. Obviously I'm not going to dwell on the negative part forever, but leaving it out just feels so wrong, and there's no other object I can think of that I have near as much of a connection with. Am I being dumb? Is this a terrible idea?","want to give a more meaningful introductory speech than ""i picked a pencil cuz i luv art lol ""afraid everyone will think i 'm a downer and a weirdo and no one will ever talk to me again .","I want to use a pen pencil as a prop in a public speaking speech to describe myself, but I'm afraid it will come off as angsty and off - putting, and I don't know how to tell the truth.","I'm going to a public speaking class where I have to talk about how I have always loved drawing and expressing myself, and use a pen as a prop to represent my anxiety and depression.

"I wanted to map out why I feel the way I do and why I've attempted suicide before. This is more of a personal monologue if anything. I'm trying to understand my past in hopes that I'll be able to tell myself that killing myself isn't the solution. Attempting to make sense of it all in chronological order Earliest suicidal thought - 2005- 12 years old. Wrote down all the ways I could kill myself in the back of my geography notebook. From what I can remember, things like injecting myself with air into my veins and learning about how it can cause death. I made a list of about 8- 10 things. Hanging myself, poisoning myself. Why did I do it? Im really not sure. I was depressed about being overweight, being terrible in school, not having many friends. I ended up failing the 7th grade that year. I was so upset. I was in disbelief and overall just crushed. 2006- 2014 A year later, things werent much better. Talking about this seems irrelevant since it was so long ago, but I think thats how It all began. Those feelings of just being crushed, isolated and defeated stuck around longer than they should have. Im not sure why I wasnt able to have some sort of appropriate coping mechanism for it all. Down the line, those mechanisms were working out emotionally in hopes to forget and numb the pain and put a pause on an issue I havent dealt with. With that came self- harm. None of that cutting shit, but punishing myself for the smallest things. if I failed something, felt bad about something or just felt inadequate in some shape or form I would punch myself enough to make it hurt, but not enough to leave lasting marks. I figured blunt force would be enough to punish myself for whatever reasons I thought I was doing, or wasnt doing. Its been a while since Ive done that, but I took it a little too far trying to hang myself on my 21st birthday Ironic, I know . In hindsight, using a belt in a closet with a rack thats shorter than you isnt logistically sound. I tried bending my knees and crouching with the belt around my neck. I tried a few more times that day, but didnt work out. Cant say Im glad it didnt as I write this. Maybe I need better planning at executing this, or I could just use the excuse that its another thing Ive failed to accomplish in my life. I honestly didnt think Id feel worse now than I did a few years ago and it honestly scares me. My thoughts of suicide and just ending it all come up more frequently than they used to. Some days it doesnt even come up, but even when I actively try to draw attention away from these thoughts, I can count on them coming up the next day, or the day after that. Nevertheless, they never truly leave me. Call them demons or thoughts, but theyre with perpetually with me. I grew up with them, moved to the US with them and graduated with them. This isnt really a cry for help, because I take responsibility for these thoughts and the actions that may take place as a result of them. Maybe Ill be around long enough to figure it out, or whatever I think it is. Depression, suicidal ideations, anxiety whatever you call it. I dont like being a victim, which is another reason I dont really think about reaching out for help. Maybe thats the exact definition of victim, depending on who you ask. amp But in the next few years, Ill either be here or I wont. I really cant say right now with certainty. Thats something no one can say with certainty. The only difference is whether It will be through my own hands or through natural causes. On days like this, I tell myself I dont want to die, and I honestly believe myself at times. Or it could be that Im just believing a convenient lie for the sake of self- preservation. I don't want to die, I really don't. I'd like to be a father one day and be somewhat successful and try to do good in the world, but I don't think this will happen. amp",Trying to make sense of my depression and suicide from a young age and mapping out what went wrong,"I've tried to kill myself before, but it did nt work out.

"I'm getting sick of this! One of the best social gatherings that tend to stick with me have been one on one conversations together alongside evening walks or one on one trips to a local cafe where we eat lunch and drink soda or coffee. People must stop thinking that conversing and talking shit is something everyone wants! Simple presence is just as rewarding if not more than talking excessively to avoid the awkward silence. Going for a silent walk with my mother and eating a boboli alone is a thousand times better than having superficial small talk with 5 strangers on an party. The rewards of knowing one doesn't have to force oneself to talk bull for the sake of being with the person is very satisfying. Knowing that you can just BE YOURSELF. Is amazing!

Can we please stop the norm and the stigma associated with talking and social situations!

"So when I 19 f was a kid, around 4- 7, I hung out with my step- cousin 23 m a lot. I had three other cousins in the same family, and they live in a different city, but whenever we visited he would always invite me to play Halo or Runescape with him, which was really cool to me because my older brother would never play with me. To cut a long story short, after attending gratuitous therapy, I've cleared up a lot of memories that I blocked from my childhood much of my life from 3- 9 was a complete blur before then and realized that that same cousin had molested me at least twice. The kicker is that, in the last few months following a suicide attempt from him, he admitted to his mother to molesting both his sister and his other step- siblings. My cousins all coroborated and revealed that the abuse had been going on for years, but true to their family's legacy that whole side of the family is in financial mental shambles he hasn't been charged. He's just had a son with his girlfriend and there's another on the way, and my aunt his mother still refuses to believe he's done what he's admitted, and let him continue to live in the same house as my cousins, before he had something akin to a mental break and attacked her, before moving in with his girlfriend again. Anyways, none of my family know that I was molested, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to tell them. In truth, I don't think they'd even believe me, or they'd just think I was making it up to get attention.

"Hi all. I have ADHD, but wasn't diagnosed until adulthood. I have the symptoms managed now and it doesn't affect me to the point of degrading the quality of my life in my significant way. However, I do think that ADHD is a deal breaker in the dating game. I've read that people with ADHD tend to marry each other a lot and it probably has to do with how neurotypical people are not that open to marrying people with ADHD or other mental disorders. I think dating is different as people are open to dating around having fuckbuddies but I think marriage is different. Tying the knot implies that you will probably have kids in your spouse and I it makes sense that neurotypical people fear that their kids may inherit ADHD. It's not that different from how some white people I know are happy to date around yet they marry someone else who is white as they don't want non- white kids who face extra racial barriers in life. I think some people do not mind marrying someone with ADHD but I think these people are usually marrying up for other aspect or settling due to not being very desirable themselves. I've seen people from the upper class saying how they don't want to marry anyone with mental disorders themselves which gives sense given how they are technically at the top of the dating pyramid and condemning people with disorders who choose to reproduce as there is a very high chance that their offspring will inherit the disorder. And honestly I think ADHD will be less of a deal breaker to some people but these people are probably not very desirable in some other way so they can't be that ""picky"". It all makes sense.

"Hey folks this is my first time posting on this sub or at all, actually so I'll try to be as succinct as I can. I was diagnosed with BPD last year after repeated emotional blowups on my then SO. At the time we were cohabiting in a city across the country from most of our friends and family. My poor mental health keeping me from work, substance abuse and impulsive spending caused me to go into debt to my partner. This resulted in my having to return to the city where we were from with them staying behind. Our plan was to maintain a long distance relationship until I was better and able to come back but, shortly after I left they told me that the way I had treated them was unacceptable and broke up with me. At the time I felt okay with it because I was devaluing them super hard and didn't think I would miss them, and because I was able to recognize that I had treated them quite poorly. It has been six months since I came home and my ex and I broke up. Since the breakup I have swung back to idealizing them. I feel like life isn't worth living without them. It feels like an essential part of who I am is gone forever. I'm also filled with guilt and shame over how horribly I treated them.

"She didnt outright say it, or I might believe its just a cry for help. My little sister shes 25, Im 28 has been on a downward slope for the past couple years and has finally hit what seems to be rock bottom. The worst part is that I havent kept in touch with her and she has no close friends to speak of. Looking back, its fucked up how I treated her when we were growing up. I spent a most of my youth searching for friends and struggling to be accepted. How I made it to where I am today is nothing short of a miracle. There was a time up until about age 12 when I remember my sister and I hanging out together. But there was some point where I must have decided that it was more important to focus on friends and I began to distance myself from my family. I think a lot of teens do. But for some reason I never came back to mend ties. It was probably out of insecurity and not yet being comfortable with who I was. I resented having my sister around during high school because I felt embarrassed by her for some stupid reason. When I left for college I put even more distance between myself and my family, I guess because it isnt cool to be close to your family dumb, I know . I finally figured myself out after college and became an entirely different person. Now Im an officer in the military, constantly on the move and only visit home once a year if Im lucky. When my sister graduated high school, she didnt know what she wanted to do with her life. She took some classes at the local community college and got her Associate Degree, then went to Apollo College for a Dental Tech certification in the nearest major city, about 45 min away. She couldnt handle being on her own or the loneliness of not knowing anyone, so she moved back in with my parents. Shes had roommates on and off since then, but there always seems to be a conflict where they part on bad terms. Now she lives by herself down the road from my folks, has a Dental Tech job that gets her about 20 hrs wk, and is looking for another bar tending waitress job quit her last one to make enough to live on. On top of it all, she recently got knocked up by some guy and had a 1st- term miscarriage. Needless to say, it was devastating to her. At the behest of my mother, I recently opened a dialog with my sister. It was awkward and I didnt know what to say after all these years of silence. Its only been a few exchanges but after all the suicide prevention training Ive received in the military, the signs are plain as day. She thinks she has nothing to live for and sees no reason to continue the painful process of living.

"First off, I'm sorry you're not happy. But EVERYONE deserves to be. Despite what we've done in our lives, we all should have the opportunity to be happy. And sometimes we hold ourselves back, but that's ok. I'm in your same exact position except my family is mostly supportive. I'm sorry you have to deal with them, and remember it isn't your fault they're shitty to their own child. School has become extra stress for no reason because I have no purpose.

"Many of these posts sound pretty paranoid about the pharmaceutical doctor conspiracy which may have merit, but the fact that they usually keep trialling different chemicals until you find the one that suits undermines that considerably. Keep in mind that paranoia and suspicion are classic symptoms of depression as well. I've been on meds for a few years, after a few false starts to identify the right one. I know that I don't like who I am off the meds. I become so much more emotional, beyond what is reasonable, and can't bear any input from people or the world around me. I feel like my old self when I'm taking them. My SO suffers from undiagnosed depression and struggles to get out of bed in the morning. He is anti- meds anti- therapy so that's hard work for both of us. It certainly complicates matters for our family, with the kids missing out on his presence because he needs to be in his cave whenever he is home. It's worth keeping in mind how your illness effects those around you although it may not be a huge factor if you are mildly depressed. I'm not cured by any means, I can't go off my meds yet, maybe never, but at least I can begin to face the world. I don't take every glance or comment as a criticism, I can give my kids the love and security they need and deserve and still find the energy I need to emotionally reassure and support my SO. I still can't cope when things go wrong or I become stressed about life but I probably wouldn't be here if I'd continued drug free. I hate to consider how that would effect my children, partner and family. My Mum is my balance, she lets me know when she's concerned about how low I am and I know I need to reassess where I'm at, it usually means I've started to skip my meds, therapy or exercise.

"I am an individual in my mid 20s and I have been under different levels of psychiatric care since I was 15 years old. Last week I started a DBT partial hospitalization program over telehealth. For the first time in my life, I have been on about a 4 - 6 months of working extremely hard at radically accepting therapy and going into therapy with an open, non- judgmental mind. I'm trying. I'm taking this seriously and I'm pushing to be optimistic. Honestly, I'm struggling. My mother is pushing me to not leave my job because I need the income and it's a very easy call center job, working from home. I was so stressed that I had two extremely long anxiety attacks, kept shaking, felt so sick, and cried while at work yesterday and today. Today, SI without intent or a plan has been on my mind all day and I broke down at work this morning sobbing. My job stresses me out because of customer interactions that go poorly and the basically nonexistent room for error nonstop being monitored, timed, graded, etc. I hate talking on the phone because of anxiety and I only took this job out of desperation. But on top of that, my boss is now expecting me to work 8 hour shifts on evenings after PO and weekend days. I'm looking at at least 14 hour days. Prior to this PO, I was sleeping about 9 - 12 hours a day easily, including at least one long nap of over 2 hours, and working on average 4 hours a day at most. I'm terrified and it feels like all I'm really looking for is approval from my mother to be able to quit my job but she disapproves. I'm going to try to get a note from my program to say I need a medical leave of absence but I'm not confident I'll get that approved by my boss. I'm seeking advice. I'm not sure if I attempt to push through and risk potential burnout or if I leave my job, and have no income. Also, I am seeking any advice, tips, or tricks for a DBT PO group program anyone would be willing to share? Any tips on certain skills? How do you implement your skills? How do I balance my desire to get the most out of therapy without oversharing? I feel like my group is very very quiet. Any recommendations for getting the ball rolling with other group members?

About 1 week ago my doctor increased my daily dose from 20 to 30 mg. 3 10mgs a day. I have taken 3 a day for a last week without issues. However last night I experienced the dizziness side effect for the 1st time with adderall, it didn't help that I didn't know what was happening and panicked a little which I think made the whole experience worse. It was about 530 at night and had just taken my 3rd adderall at 430pm. I was sitting at my computer reading a text book for my class and I could not focus at all, my mind was just jumping from subject to subject without the ability to control it, usually the adderall helps with this. Anyways I got frustrated and jumped up out of my chair and stood there for a second, I got a light headed feeling, but it didn't go away like normal. Not experiencing this before, I decided to walk upstairs to tell my mom I was not feeling well. I walked by her saying this and walked into my room only to collapse to the floor from light headedness just before I got to my bed. Not to mention I was sweating profusely, which turned Into being really cold 2 minutes later and just kind of went away. Now I think it's worth noting that I did smoke weed about 30 minutes before this. Later that night I got the same exact thing, only this time I was more ready for it. I stayed seated for the whole period, but my entire body was pouring out sweat in my chair just sitting there. I also smoked weed about 30 minutes before the 2nd incident. I'm not sure if the weed is causing it, or is just not mixing well with the adderall. Not sure but I've been smoking without any issues for the last 2 months on adderall. Just wanted to share, see if anybody has any insight. I have called my doctor and let her know exactly what happened. I have a feeling it's related to blood pressure but I'm not sure. I bought a manual checker but I could not locate a pulse in my left arm In order to get a BP reading. Also just to note, I drink a protein shake every morning and usually a snack. I missed my snack this day, and also didn't eat dinner til about 8pm that night after the incident, I have also mindfullu been trying to drink lots of water. While I don't think these are what's causing it, it could have been related","got extreme light headedness unexpectedly after my 3rd daily adderall and ended up getting so dizzy I collapsed before I got to my bed to lay down , was also sweating profusely .

"I've got OCD and social anxiety disorder with my ADHD. Treated them first since my ADHD hadn't been diagnosed at the time. Guilt was mixed in with the relief. I could recognize it was irrational, but I felt it anyway. I was still close to my oldest sister, who was incredibly anti- meds in general, so the experience was complicated. Like, holy cow relief, but why couldn't I achieve this without a pill? It was my stimulant that freed me from my irrational guilt, oddly enough, and eventually helped me process that said sister was bad for my mental health and essentially cut her off as she grew more toxic in response to my continued treatment. I love her and enjoyed a lot of my relationship with her, but I don't need close exposure to someone who's going to judge me for following recommended interventions to be my best self. I've got enough on my plate already. Ironically, I'm pretty sure she has ADHD too and would also greatly benefit from medical intervention","Felt guilt for medicating anxiety initially , but probably due to external judgment for medicating at all .","I've been there, I've done it, and I don't want to do it again.","I've got OCD, social anxiety, and ADHD.

"I quit Paxil after 10 years of being on it. Doctors downplay the side effects because as along as you are taking it, you will continue to visit them in order to get the script filled.

I smoke pot, drink tons of beer now but consider myself in control. The funniest thing about Paxil is you will justify any abuse because when taking it your conscious doesn't work.

"NT, but I also have a habit of answering truthfully, and as a result, I also have a policy of ""Don't ask questions if you don't want to hear the answer.""My good friends have figured this out, and if I suspect they don't want to know the answer i.e. if it's particularly personal or controversial , I will give them an opportunity to back out before I answer. My family, however, has still not figured out that I am not going to tell ""polite lies""to fit in, and as a result I often find myself at odds with them. To answer your question, here's why I think they ask and then get upset. They ask, because they like or respect you as a person and honestly believe that because of that they want to know your opinion on topic . Furthermore, in our society, it is widely accepted as a good thing to be open- minded and open to hearing new opinions and debating your own. They want the acceptance that comes from being perceived as open- minded and open to debate, but what they think of as ""debate""winds up looking an awful lot like ""yelling at you and insulting you for no good reason.""It's a surprisingly common problem. Another reason for getting upset when your opinion is not the one they wanted or perhaps expected is that when they began the conversation, they had something of a script in their mind for how the conversation would go. They've likely had similar conversations with other people before, and there is a pattern, which they expect it to follow. When your response to their question steps outside the expected pattern of responses that was set up in their minds, they get upset. Much as people on the autism spectrum may get upset when an encounter deviates widely from the way they had expected and prepared for it to go, NTs may do the same thing when they receive a particularly unexpected response in a conversation. A final reason, which I have postulated, is that sometimes, people and perhaps NTs in particular have a very low self- esteem, which they make every effort to conceal in various ways, often with great success . For such people, if they consider themselves to have invested significant time and energy in a particular opinion, or if an opinion relates directly to them i.e. ""Does this dress make me look fat"", then they are likely to feel personally attacked by opinions which they consider to be opposing them. Someone who owns 5 guns and goes to a gun club every day may say ""All this effort to take guns away from people is stupid and illegal, amiright, ""but get very upset if you say ""No, I don't believe you are. I believe opposing view points about guns .""The reason he would get upset in this case is that, by supporting even just in your mind gun control laws, he considers you to be opposing him, viewing him as immoral to the same extent that you believe gun control is moral, and actively desiring to take away items and pleasures that belong to him. He believes that your opposing opinion implies all of that largely due to his experiences with other people who have nothing to do with you","NTs have a habit of using patterns they see in people 's beliefs to assume certain traits or beliefs in people who hold a certain opinion . Odds are , they 're upset not because of what you think but because of what they think you think and or how they think your thoughts reflect on them .","I think NTs get upset when they don't get the response they expected, because they have a pattern in their mind of how the conversation is supposed to go, and when it doesn't follow that pattern they expect it to, they get upset. NTs may also have low self - esteem, which they try to conceal in various ways, often with great success.",NTs may get upset if you don't give them the expected response they expect.

Why do they want to know your opinion on a topic which relates directly to them, but do not feel personally attacked by it? Why are they so quick to get upset at you if you disagree with their opinion?",0.2857142857142857,0.034188034188034185,0.16806722689075632,0.21505376344086022,0.021978021978021976,0.10752688172043011,0.2608695652173913,0.012578616352201259,0.14906832298136646

"For me and I know this is true for many others as well , it all boils down to living in America, where the economy is poor and everything is ridiculously over- priced. Especially health care of any sorts. Prior to turning eighteen a few years ago, I had a brief stay in a mental hospital, and 98 of the patients were in the same boat. They were poor, they didn't have a high school diploma or GED and I have neither of those, either due to failing because of mental illness, and therefore they couldn't get a job. Without a job, they had no way to afford decent health insurance or even any treatment whatsoever. It's hard to even work towards a GED or job when you can't even manage to get out of bed and feed yourself or shower for weeks at a time, y'know what I mean? Most mentally ill people live impoverished lives and many are unfortunately homeless. Some younger people that I've spoken to had difficult situations, where their parents are abusive and neglectful and wouldn't allow them to seek treatment, due to the strong stigma surrounding mental illness. They're often told, ""it's all in your head""or ""you're being dramatic""or ""that doesn't exist""or to just ""deal with it.""I firmly believe that medication saves lives, but that it's not a one- size- fits- all solution, and subsequently it's not for everyone. Whenever I had the ability to take medication, I noticed a significant improvement after about two years of consistent treatment. It's been almost two years since I've been medicated and I'm honestly the most absolute, useless, sick wreck without it","I feel like it 's a case - by - case basis but I genuinely believe that poor healthcare , stigma , and neglect could sum up the majority of reasons as to why a person is n't taking medication or otherwise receiving treatment therapies , etc .

"I'm mid 30s and over the past 3 years have been having epiphanies about certain self- loathing harming behaviours, tendencies, thought patterns of mine and how they occurred as a result of largely unintentional and or unwitting, maybe emotional abuse and neglect as a child and adolescent. Since I am now seriously considering having a kid of my own, the idea has awaken me to the realities of how my parents brought me up and how their tendencies towards me set certain patterns in place in my mind. My parents are divorced, in their 70's and their health is starting to fail. My father is increasingly bigoted in his old age which is exacerbated by his equally bigoted and crass wife, he no longer speaks to me because she doesn't like me which is fine by me. I have recently stopped speaking to my mother after an explosive argument. I have been trying to hide these revelations from her because I see her as weak and unable unwilling to handle any discussion over how she might have done something wrong she will NEVER accept blame for anything, she will outright lie about something before apologizing for anything and then get insanely hysterical when you say she's lying . She is pathetic, wallowing in her depression and makes zero effort to make her life better. I spent the better part of a decade after they divorced trying to help her learn computer skills, find jobs, do anything. She resists or complains or comes up with excuses. She has no other family at this point, she's so miserable she just drinks herself to sleep whenever she's not working. Her being so alone is the only thing that makes me feel even slightly guilty and the only reason I think I've bothered with her these past years, even though that is her own damn fault. Suddenly pity isn't enough motivation to keep me in her life after I have started to realize what she did to my psyche all those years as a child and continues to try to do in my adulthood. She probably isn't even aware of it, and she vehemently denies everything, even denies things she said that my husband has witnessed. She is a gaslighter, an emotionally manipulative harpy. At this point, I assume she is half senile at 70 or at least her brain has somewhat wasted away from all the drinking. I have very little interest in bothering to resume relationship with her. For years now, every interaction with her drains me fully. There is zero benefit to me when interacting with her, since nothing positive for me ever comes of it, everything in her life always has been and always will be miserable and terrible and of course, not her fault. I am tired of being concerned for her, I have basically no respect for her anymore based on how she's decided to live her life after my parents divorced right after I left the house, I mediated and spoke between them for years after despite repeatedly telling them I wasn't their lawyer . Now though, I don't even care about the divorce stuff. It's remembering how they spoke to me when I was little. It's remembering how they singled me out and made me feel alone, worthless and ugly. I am so angry. I am SO FUCKING ANGRY. It has been now at least 2 years of this kind of anger. I feel blinded by my anger sometimes when I think of them, literally cannot see things in front of me, just feel anger and hate that reaches my fingers and toes, I feel it through my whole body. I am angry at myself that it took me so long to see them for who they really are. I am angry at myself for blaming myself for their shitty behaviour. The last text I sent to my mother said ""Children don't learn to hate themselves from anyone but their parents.""As parents they should have known better and done better. They treated me like an outcast from the family and teased me for being ""strange""and ""liberal""read empathetic towards others - they are a most self- righteous and fairly bigoted type of people since I was too young to understand, it started at least as early as 5, possibly earlier. Later, I was a self- harming and suicidal teen and they didn't push therapy or anything. They knew and they definitely had the means to pay so it was not a matter of affording therapy. Then my father sent me off to college with the promise of paying for it, which he didn't and apparently never planned to. I have been stuck with 40k of student loans for 10 years that I can't consistently pay, because I went under the assumption that he was going to keep his promise. A few years ago he cuts off my mom's alimony and since my brother refuses to help he is also very comfortable financially, having had the classes he failed out of paid for and a job handed to him by dear ol dad , I am expected to pick up the slack and be the emotional and financial support for my mother. She now works at Walmart, hates it, and even though she got a better job elsewhere, she quit and went back to Walmart because she didn't want to learn a new POS system. I am disgusted by her lack of effort in everything. I hustle my ass off as an independent contractor in my field but haven't been able to maintain regular, stable work clients so financially I don't really have interest in sacrificing my financial future so that I can pick up after her lack of effort and my parents' lack of planning for retirement. ","Everyone tells me I will regret not forgiving my elderly parents when they die probably soonish . I am so fucking angry , I do n't know what forgiveness means or what it feels like or looks like .

It would only be met with defensive vitriol and more shit about how I am too emotional and more gaslighting BS . How can I move past this and maybe forgive them ?

"Hey everyone! So my girlfriend and I have been living together for almost a year now and our relationship is still going strong. However, she really likes clean spaces and gets very stressed out when the apartment is dirty. While I try to contribute, usually she ends up being the the one to clean up most of the messes that are made - the one who does the dishes, cleans the bathroom, and straightens everything up. The reason for this seems to revolve around my mental illness. I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and with their powers combined, it's basically really hard for me to start things I don't want to do homework, going to the grocery store, etc .

I said yeah, it seems thats my sweet spot because whenever I take 4 classes I fail one, haha. Which had almost always been true my whole college career. Ive been on academic probation twice.

The dog came over, few hours later I went to work, when I came back from work the dog had gotten sick throw up diarrhea she was still moving around and seemed okay otherwise. I assumed she was just anxious. As I was cleaning she got sick again. Still moving around and okay otherwise. During the time I was cleaning I lit some incense where I think I went wrong. We slept Friday night into Saturday morning. She seemed okay Saturday morning still walking around, eating, drinking. But she threw up again. I went to the store as I was low on cleaning supplies and my friend whom the dog belongs to for now suggested to try imodium or pepto tried pepto during this time while I'm cleaning again I lit another incense I bring this up because I cant think of any other thing I did that could have hurt her she stopped throwing up which I took as a good sign..she was still drinking so also took that as a good sign. She pooped a single solid healthy looking poop which I also thought was a good sign. It was during this time that I realize maybe it was the incense that made her sick. So I google and find out that yes incense can make most animals sick. I figured all of this was okay because I hadn't lit any sticks in a few hours and she seemed to be improving. It was my grandmother's birthday and because I thought things were in the clear I went to visit my her. When I came back home about 4 hours later the dog was no longer breathing or responsive took her to a vet and she had passed. I'm so hurt sad disappointed in myself I dont even know what to say or do. My friend insist that I shouldn't blame myself but how can I not?",Dog sat a foster dog for a long time family friend thinking it would help me getting over the loss of my own dogs .

"Hey all! I can imagine we all have immense trouble waking up in the morning, but does anyone elses brain take WAY too long to be coherent and functional? This is mostly on 7- 8 hours of sleep.

"i feel like people dont take me seriously when i tell them about my anxiety. everyday like im worried for no reason. at all. heart pounds thru my head. cant breathe. racy thoughts. i panic. constant fight or flight. noone knows how bad i cry bc its so much. i want to be free. i always thought feelin this way was normal. as a kid growin up, i didnt even realize my whole childhood dealt with general anxiety. at the age of 10, fractured my wrist and had to wear a cast for 6 weeks. spent everyday wearing an oversized sweater and going to physical education in that sweater, running miles with my cast hiding beneath the way too big for me sweater. fast forward, when adults and school counselors talk to me about my bad grades and my attendance, i get so emotional and tears roll down my face as much as i try to prevent them. im emotional. so much. then i missed class because i had the freedom. i lived with my grandparents who worked most days of the week. my mom was in my life technically, but she lived an hour away. she wasnt living with me so she never knew i was ditching. one day led to the second to the third. domino effect. one week led to the next to a month. one month became two months which ended in three months of ditching school. and when i mean ditching i mean full on did not go to ANY class or school in general. i was practically missing in school, . i blocked all friends blocked all contact with the world. they thought i went missing. i pulled it off for 3 months, i was a good liar, good hider. very sneaky. these thoughts have been here my whole life, dont try and say weed is making me paranoid. it can and does at times, but way before weed has been in my life, these feelings were present. those actions i did, the sweater, the domino effect of ditching. it was from anxiety. i remember clearly telling myself i cant go to class. i fucked up its already been 1 week i havent gone how do i explain what the fuck happened and where ive been?! that was the thought. what would people think! ? how do i explain? theyll think im just a kid who ditches and fails all his classes. this was how time kept making it worse. the weeks went by as months went by and the phrase echoed dramatically in my brain as the 3rd month went by. now how do i even go to school if ive been missing for 3 months, surely i couldnt and i never did. until my mom got in so much trouble her only option was to force me and take me back to live with her, where i was then under supervision, so she could take me to school as opposed to no one watching me at home. i just wish i could stop these thoughts. the feeling of constant worrying. about what people think about how i look, about what if this happens?

"For about a year my dad, me and my brother moved into a trashy cheap house in the worst and most dangerous suburb in the south. I first hated it, especially since I just moved from my upper- class mother's expensive beachside apartment. I was scared to go to sleep every night, he never had much food, place smelt like shit, and It just made me really anxious living there, and I was in a pretty bad mental state. However, five months later I find an old friend, who just so happens to live in the same area a couple streets down from me. From then on, everything changed. Me and her were hanging out everyday. We went on adventures and hikes to the local creek, went to the shopping center after school, went from park to park, we became best friends while also meeting and making new and other best friends. Even though we faced problems like gang violence, we were happy together. I can't remember a time when I was genuinely that happy in my life. I've always had trouble fitting in and making friends, so this was something special. However, one night everything changed. See my dad can be pretty abusive. One night we were arguing, I didn't want anything to escalate so I closed the door, only until he kicks my door, comes running up to me and bashes me against a wall. That night, straight away after, I decided to run away. I ran out the house with nothing but the clothes I already had, and went to my best friends house for the night. My dad told me to go back, but I dont want to. This has happened many times before and I knew if I go back like I did last time he wont learn his lesson and he'll do it again. I haven't talked to my dad ever since, as heartbreaking as it is, I don't want to, I can't. Few weeks later with living at my mum's she managed to put me on a goverment payment plan and rent out a room in a shared home close to her. I'm so far from my friends, I had to leave all them behind so quickly, I miss them, they were like family. Now, I lay in bed alone after not talking to anyone for a whole week. Pizza boxes on the floor from my uber eats addiction, trash cans overflowing, feeling lonley as fuck.. Even though It wasn't safe for me living there.. I fucking miss it so bad. Does anyone have any tips or advice for me to be happy with my life now and start a new one? I feel too lonley","I moved in wirh my abusive dad in a shitty house in the ghetto , made the best friends I ever had and a great social life , one night I ran away from there after my dad beat and now I live far , I had to leave my friends , my family , my happiness behind .

"Probably the body language. When I was a kid the bullies tended to pick on me at the very first moment they saw me. Now as an adult people see me as the weird guy immediately, they think twice now to make fun of me because I've gotten muscular my face is still nerdy tho, can't help it , but I've heard people talk shit about me on my back and I've called it out. That's why I practically have no friends, and I can't say it's my fault that's just the way I was born. I keep fighting people all the time, I decided nobody is gonna hurt me again emotionally and if one day they pull a gun on me and shoot me I will still die happily because I didn't bend my knees, I defended myself to the very end.

"and I really like her. I spent most of my day with her today because she was training me on the cash register.

"Hello, this is an alt as my SO is also on Reddit. I've M30 been in a long term relationship with my SO F28 for five years. We have a home together and have a great relationship. I've been going to a therapists who suggested I be more open with my family history, so we've been chatting about my past. I will be the first to admit that I didn't have a great childhood. She knew that my parents were abusive, but didn't know to what extent. After opening up to her she didn't take it very well, in fact she was pretty horrified. She cried, got really angry, and started yelling that I was literally tortured. I didn't think that it was that important, but she's really latched on to the torture thing. My father used to make me reach for a spot on a wall as high as I could while on the tips of my toes. He'd draw a line on the wall at the end of my longest finger, if I dipped below the line, looked away from the line, checked the time, or made a noise I'd be hit in the back of the legs with a paddle hard enough to bleed and have to do 15- 30 more minutes. It sucked, I used to have nightmares about it. The thing is, if she considered this literal torture, then the other stuff is going to be way harder to tell her. I started with something that I thought was pretty mild. The problem is that i still talk to my parents. We aren't close but, I still see them once a month or so, mainly to support my sister. My SO is sweet and a great person, however she does have a temper and is very protective. How do I talk to her about some of the harder aspects of my life without upsetting her to the point where she wants to vengeance kill my parents? Or should I keep it to myself?","told partner of abuse experienced as a child , she is shook . Problem , I started of with someone mild .

"Well, it's hard to give you reasons to live when my bias differs from yours about suicide. My opinion is that if you're considering suicide, you're not thinking logically for a variety of reasons. It doesn't matter how big or small the reason may be, because we are all different. Depression happens to everyone - but suicidal thoughts is when is should be taken most seriously. Anyways as to those reasons this'll be a long post . But I'll give it a try, if it means changing your mind about it! Considering suicide at all means you should see a doctor immediately for a few reasons I'll make a list It's harmful. Not just to you, but to others. What would the impact be on any of your loved ones if you decided to kill yourself? What if that made THEM suicidal? I don't mean to guilt you, but when I was suicidal, doctors considered this a form of selfishness. It isn't selfish, it's caring for others before yourself. But that brings me to the next point It's selfless. How do you know that these emotions aren't brought on from something that you could get help from? For example, 8 years ago I wanted to kill myself. I tried 3 times. But I came to a stark realization that it was a combination of a chemical imbalance seratonin, etc , bad timing lost my job, my highschool sweetheart broke up with me , and I was using drugs. As mentioned in my second point, there are countless of reasons that you could be feeling the way you are, whether consciously or subconsciously. This is something I learned from therapy. The subconscious things that you aren't thinking about, but are still there in your head is one of the most powerful players in our emotional behaviours. I didn't consider the fact my drug use was contributing to my depression as naive as that may be , and I certainly didn't consider my diet was poor, my social life was lacking I couldn't bear particular things that I wasn't exactly cognitively aware of. I think most doctors at least the ones that don't believe in assisted suicide consider any logic behind rationalizing suicide to be a sign of major depression - something that can be fixed. It doesn't matter if you're battling cancer, or having family trouble, or just dealing with a stressful period in your time suicide is irrational. I'm sure there are many out there who would disagree with my opinion when it comes to this with the elderly. As I said, that's your bias. But the majority of rational thinkers consider any suicidal tendency or thought to be something that shouldn't be ignored",Suicidal thoughts are not rational thoughts . There 's no reason not to seek help with for them . Rational minds consider life to be something worth living for whether inevitably in the short term or long term . But not by our own hands .,"Suicidal thoughts are irrational for a variety of reasons, but they should be taken seriously. It's not selfish, it's selfless, and there are many reasons to live.

"I just lost my FP who I was with on and off with over a period of a year and a half. He never developed real feelings for me because I split on him pretty early on in the relationship after being triggered. I kept trying to get back to him but being a quiet BPD, I was anxious all the time and was hypersensitive to rejection. We ended up only having random texting sessions and a sexual relation. He has now physically left the city, and cut all contact with me. He was the type I wanted on a A4 paper, except he lacked enough empathy to deal with my outbursts and weird behavior. I also told him about my disorder, but in a very disjointed way. I am getting better day by day as Im in therapy and Ive done a lot of research. However, Im lost. I feel much better now that hes gone since I cant do push and pull anymore but Im ruminating and regretting like crazy. I feel like hes become the one who got away. However, at the same time this is a perfect situation for me to improve and focus on myself as Im rather stable. I dont want to get involved with another guy if I cant break the push- pull pattern.

"Hey there! I was diagnosed around his age too, though I only had a few tics here and there before hand. Here are some things that Ive found have helped others and some that help me. Please remember that there will be a lot of trial and error and that it may not happen right away. I hope this helps! How To Calm The Tics not in any sort of order - Exercise Movement Getting exercise in as often as possible is important anyway, but it can also help put the energy that causes tics into something else. Also, making sure to just get moving every day may help too. Doesnt have to be anything strenuous dancing, walking, yoga are all great! Nutrition Of course eating and drinking the recommended amount is already helpful, but Ive found that making sure I am hydrated is really helpful for reducing any other stress that could contribute to tics. - Sensory Input Basically anything dealing with the five senses that make him comfortable or help calm him. Examples include favorite candles, soft fabrics in clothes, Music Sounds, fidget cubes, Rubics cubes, chewy gems. Chewy games are basically jewelry that you can chew on to help with sensory input . I know you mentioned that mental stimulation causes issues, so Rubics cube may not be the best option. - Open communication Making sure he doesnt feel uncomfortable showing his tics or ashamed of his tics is really helpful. I find that if I am uncomfortable I will tic more, so creating a safe space is really nice. - Medication I know some people may be adverse to taking meds, but I just wanted to cover all the bases. I was put on clonidine to help my tics specifically and Zoloft to help with the anxiety that helped fuel the Tourettes. Talking to a neurologist or a psychiatrist may be beneficial as they can lay out your options and work with you to find out what works best for him. - Therapy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is often an option suggested to people with Tourettes. I do believe that its a therapy designed to help redirect tics into less harmful ones or simply into other activities. Im so sorry you had that awful experience with that therapist people like that make me so angry. Again, I hope this has been a little bit helpful, and I wish you both luck on this journey! Remember to be kind and gentle to not only each other but yourselves. Things like this take time and effort, and sometimes it will feel like you have neither. Take it as slow or as fast as need be when experimenting with what works best, and get good rest! Sleep is important as well!

"So I work for this company, and they outsource for Optimum. I work from home. At first, during the interview, I was told I'd be working 3- 12. Then, during training, I was told that they do the schedules a month in advance, and that we would NOT be working 3- 12, we may need to work 9- 5, depending on ""the needs of the client"". Then, we were told that they do not do the schedules a month in advance, there's no way to determine what the needs would be. They said they do the schedules a week in advance, ""depending on the needs of the client""I asked if it was possible we would be working 3- 12 one week and then 9- 5 the next. I was told they weren't offering morning schedules so it wasn't likely. Today I'm scheduled 10am- 6pm. That would be a morning schedule. The first computer they sent me to work from home with had a failing network card, so I had to send it back to them in exchange for another computer. They want 100 usage of their tools on calls, but the tools crash almost every other call. Their tools crash so much we actually had to go over how to close them in task manager and re- open them. When I asked how long it's been that the tools were unstable, my trainer was actually so stupid to say ""as far as I know they aren't unstable""while we're literally going over how to re open them when they crash. I actually had to explain to her that if the tools crash a lot, that means they're unstable. Another new rep said the tools crashing on most of the calls made it really difficult to have 100 usage. ""Well it could be a number of things, it could be user error, it could be having so many windows open causing the programs to freeze""We're these tools tested AT ALL? Apparently not. I couldn't believe that was the response we got. The tools are clearly unstable. Thursday I had a customer on hold for 45 minutes waiting for assistance that we were promised to get during our first two weeks. I watched as the people who were supposed to be helping me have a conversation in chat, laughing it up. I eventually begin to get a response, and it's very clear they aren't listening to what I'm saying. I had this customer on hold for almost an hour, to be told that a supervisor was already looking into the issue, there was nothing that we could do, and if I had looked into the house history earlier I would have seen the note from the supervisor. I've worked in this environment before, looking in a customer's history is the first thing I do. There WERE NO NOTES FROM ANY SUPERVISOR. Yesterday, I had three teeth removed. I had to miss a day.

". Today was a big day for me and I just need to share it with someone. Ive been having headaches for about a month now, and today I my body finally gave up on me. Around a month ago I started working my ass off at work since we had a few people leave and I needed to fill in until we found replacements. I kept going, going, going with no break and felt fine. After about a week or 2, I ended one of the work days extremely weak and shaky and was about to pass out, and could feel a panic attack coming on. Im also currently going through divorce, though I feel pretty good about it. Well, this morning I just about passed out again. I felt like I was going to puke, I couldnt stand, and I was extremely weak and shaky. My first thought is always that Im dying and I have cancer or a brain tumor or something. I have a pretty big fear of doctors and needles, but I felt like I really needed to go because something was really wrong. I forced myself to go, which cased even more anxiety, and I knew I would need a blood test. I spoke extensively about everything going on in my life and how I had been feeling, and the doctor I got was so nice. He also struggles with anxiety and said that thats what is happening to me. He gave me some Xanax, which Ive never had before, and then I had a blood test done. I cannot even begin to tell you how proud I am for taking myself to the doctor AND getting a blood test done. I stayed calm and it wasnt even that bad. Growing up, I would go into a full blown panic attack just by hearing the word needle, and today I faced my fear! I got home and took the Xanax and I cant believe how much it helped. I wish I tried it earlier. Game changer for sure! Today was a wake up call for me. I realized that I truly do struggle with anxiety and need to start taking care of myself. It was nice to have answers and to hear that I wasnt dying","Nearly passed out today .

"One of the most jaw- dropping, heartfelt, and relieving moments of my life was when I was able to read 10 assigned pages of my textbook without being distracted. Total self- control like no other felt achieved. My phone could be ringing, people could be talking, chairs could be creaking and the only voice I would be able to hear is the one in my mind reading. I was on 18 mg Concerta, one day after my recent diagnosis. In less than a week of use, the effectiveness of the medication dropped completely and it only had minimal side effects. However, Increasing my dosage to 27 unexpectedly turned for the worse. Although at times I was able to concentrate at the comfort of my home, Id receive extreme sudden and anxious urges to go to the bathroomevery hour it was the worst in middle of class or exam. The more I felt myself holding it in, the more anxious I became. And once I dashed to use the restroom, Id stand in front of the urinal and had nothing to even pee. Claustrophobia manifested itself as well I couldnt sit next to a window on the train if someone sat next to me without the urge to stand up and leave. Taking exams in crammed lectures made me want to cry. These side effects among others persisted for over a week after I stopped taking. I was beginning to question myself to what extent do I even have ADHD. I have good grades and friends, but then I realized I cheat on exams like a professional. My coping skills were well shaped from the adolescent anxiety to succeed. But for a first year college student, I feel like I have less anxiety than most students do high school taught me to take everything as a learning opportunity, therefore I dont feel stressed everyday from failing schoolwork. Moreover many college classes I am taking now are repeats from AP classes in high school. This isnt necessarily good as stress helped me get things done. Switching to Adderall XR felt better with the side effects but the extent I am losing hope on it as well. It loses effectiveness in 3 days, until I increase my dosage again. It doesnt anything better than a cup of coffee. The ritalin when it worked well gave me full mental control. Adderall would sometimes help me stay on task, but I am still very easily distracted and incapable of doing more mentally investing tasks. Even reading. I have concluded that it is what it is and maybe I will be able to find a better medication sooner or later When I took 10 mg extra one day, similar symptoms of claustrophobia and needing to use the bathroom reoccurred. A guy I recently dated was the biggest book worm I ever known. Moreover, he told me he is a software engineer and when he codes or reads, nothing around him distracts him. Oh how I envy that. He told me all about the books he has read and questioned about my favorite books. My stomach sank. It reminded me that I never enjoyed any chapter books as a child or teenager because I could not read functionally. I impulsively ended my connection with him because I thought he would just distract me - also sad and regrettable decision. I had a healthy breakfast today, took 15 mg adderall and went to the library. After 2 hours of doing God knows what pacing around the library, I finally decided on two books. I opened one and realized I was on one short page for 10 minutes, rereading each time I got distracted by my own intrusive thoughts and external stimuli. I gave up","Current meds seem to be ineffective and more problematic . Wish I could read novels among other things for mere enjoyment or even my own lengthy reddit post to correct for mistakes .

"I have watched Raya and the Last Dragon about 8 times since June 4. Here are my thoughts Disney Pixar have nailed facial expressions on their digital characters I was able to connect emotionally with the characters throughout most of the entire motion picture. The soundtrack is always a large part of any movie, and they did a great job with it. If you compare Raya and the Last Dragon to Toy Story the first one , Pixars first feature- length film, they have made so many advancements in detail with computer graphics. The closeups especially are amazing. The combat scenes were amazingly choreographed. The twists were somewhat predictable, but they all happened earlier than I was expecting. The things I dislike are very few, but there are still a decent amount. Some of the short parts of dialogue made me cringe. Im used to seeing dragons with scales instead of fur, but it didnt take away much from the film other than the fact that it looks like a furry character . I am American, so I dont have first- hand experience with southeast Asian culture which means I cannot make accurate statements about it. I can however say that from seeing behind the scenes documentaries, that they research culture, history, and local mythology a lot before they start writing scripts or storyboards. I have seen the behind the scenes documentaries behind Moana Mori culture , Soul African- American culture , and Frozen Frozen 2 Scandinavian culture . All of these views behind the scenes give me trust that they put forth their best effort to avoid offending groups of people from certain geographical regions or people who may be more familiar with the culture there","This movie is amazing The visuals , soundtrack , sound design , character building , story flow , and all other elements of film production work together to make this movie amazing . Some lines are cringe , and I think a few furries may have taken over Disney for this movie . Given their history , I trust Disney Animation Studios to avoid offending people who defend their culture . I can go into much more detail about specific scenes or the soundtrack and how each musical instrument adds to it .

"Im going to offer a different perspective to consider. Its not an answer, but I hope it helps. Mental Health is too frequently thought of as medicine, but it really has two branches that would be better thought of as a science divided into therapy and analysis. Medicine is complex, but there are almost always direct causes and clear goals, even if they are wrong. A lot of mental health is treated this way. Something is wrong and we are going to find it and fix it sure maybe, but not usually with a pill so that it goes away quickly and forever because you are back to normal. Even mental health issues that are entirely medical are chronic conditions that require monitoring and maintainance. There is no simple. This is less because of the complexity and more because of how we treat it. Think about what it would be like if we went to a psychologist every time a life event caused an emotional reaction that had a similar impact to the flu. We dont take very good care of ourselves. Treatment comes from therapy. Analysis informs therapy. Think about it like having a bad knee. There are immediate things to be done, maybe pharmaceutical, behavioral, or in terms of getting additional support. In the intermediate term you work to undo damage and get functional. In the long term you might be close enough to normal that you get by on your own, but usually either you hurt it again because you didnt resolve the underlying problem that hurt you in the first place or its that the last injury left you in a state where you were more likely to be injured. Either way, if you dont go do extensive analysis to find those problems you likely wont find a long term solution. Once you do find it you still need to do the work to correct it. You may have walked funny or had bad shoes. Maybe you were in an accident and you havent adapted to new weaknesses. Maybe you dont just hurt it again but you hurt it worse or hurt something else trying to avoid being hurt. The conditions you are describing are like saying you have a torn tendon. It doesnt talk about the muscle damage or the stretched and weakened ligament. They are focused on the main problem at hand","Symptoms are easier to treat than problems . Untreated problems generate more problems . Our best systems for dealing with this are frequently not even trying to deal with the problems , just the symptoms .","Mental health is like a bad knee. There are immediate things to be done to fix it, but the long term work is the work to undo the damage and fix the underlying problem that hurt you in the first place.

I tried many different medications but not many of them worked for me, but the ones that did work made me feelweird.

"Hey y'all just wanted to share that I found out that I have ASD. How did I found out? Ehh I'm an immigrant, from Venezuela to be exact, and I've been living in the USA for about 3 years. Never new I was anywhere close to being something out of the ordinary when I was in Venezuela, in the United States, however that was turned upside down. Here I learned about sexuality, gender identity, and most importantly neurodiversity. Of course I knew that people with autism and other mental disabilities existed but nothing more that that. I started to learn more about it and I found out that ADHD filled almost every box to why I acted so out of the norm. I communicated this to my parents and they decided to take me to a psychologist, here's when it gets interesting. You see, at the psychologist they had to get my medical story idk if that's the right term, English is hard here's where I found out that I have mild ASD and hyperactivity. So, I guess that explains somethings. The reason this was kept from me was because of the country we came from.

"I started 10 mg of Celexa 2 weeks ago today. Let me back up a little by saying I have suffered with depression since early teens maybe longer but my memory really start in early teens and have tried that i can remember in no order prozac, paxil, zoloft, fluoxetine, and wellbutrin had a severe suicidal reaction to that one . Zoloft being the last one I tried. Prozac I didnt notice any change that I can remember Paxil would work for like a week and i would crash Fluoxetine made me sleep all the tiiiime! And zoloft started to feel ok, but never really went beyond that So i went to my doctor two weeks ago, because i was off of zoloft for a few month, my anxiety was getting unbearable now that i got back in school. I could not concentrate and got two D grades later retook them and got B grades! Go me! And I just could not let my depression and anxiety get in the way of my school like that again. He wrote down the SSRIs I have tried before, and told me he would put me on something different. I also asked for an anxiety medication since it is my main struggle. And he prescribed me Celexa and Atarax. Now after about 5 days I started feeling the effect, I typically start feeling effects with in the first week, so I was like cool! But after the 7 day mark I felt something I have not felt in so long I forgot what the feeling felt like and that is happy. I was actually happy for the first time in as long as I could remember.

"So, I've known this person for 2 years and him and I have been dating for 4 months. We love each other and we're very similar people with pretty much all of the same values. The problem is, my anxieties and insecurities have really been getting in the way at times. As happy as I am to be with him, when anything even slightly goes wrong I start having all of these repetitive anxious thoughts and I don't know how to work through it. I struggle to be assertive as it is so it's hard for me to always tell him when something he does bothers me but the problem is that I get so anxious thinking about it that I usually start shutting him out because I don't want him to see me that anxious and in such a bad state. I want to talk to him rationally. Have any of you guys ever experienced this? Is there anything that helps? I am in therapy but I just started with a new person and I'm still getting to know her so it hasn't helped much just yet. Plus I can't take anti- anxiety medications. My boyfriend knows I have anxiety and I sometimes get very nervous when we're together. He usually gives me a hug or holds me for a while and it makes me feel much better. But when I get into these sorts of ""melt- down""states, I really don't want him to be subjected to it. I want to work through it so he doesn't have to carry that burden and I also want to work through it so I can effectively communicate things to him that bother me. As there are sometimes legitimate issues but my anxiety just makes it so hard to deal with. Does anyone else have repetitive thoughts? What has helped? Also, part of why these repetitive thoughts start occurring is because he lives an hour away from me and is currently working full time for the summer so I can't talk things out with him right away.

" Ive had anxiety for over a decade, and had improved a lot over the years, but I think after a traumatic event a copuple years ago, a really stressful job and then the pandemic, Ive relapsed a lot. after a year of staying home and only seeing my and my boyfriends family, I got vaccinated and have been catching up with all of my friends, hanging out multiple times a week. I get really really anxious before asking none of them ever hit me up first which makes things harder and before meeting up but we have a good time when were together and theres no awkward silences, tons of smiles and laughs, etc. its just the anticipation beforehand that gets me. yesterday I ended up with multiple plans dinner with boyfriends family and then hanging out with some friends at their new house. after dinner I went home to put my to go box in the fridge and touch base before heading back out. noticed I started getting heart palpitations but didnt think much of it because mentally I wasnt that nervous. then my friend texts me the address and suddenly, bam, first panic attack in years. I started struggling to breathe and then I thought oh no, please not this shit again and just started shaking and crying, body going numb, feeling dizzy and weak and just curled up into fetal position for about 40 minutes, feeling like I was going crazy you know, the usual symptoms. Im kind of frustrated because I used to get multiple panic attacks a week in high school, it was absolutely miserable and I felt I had come a long way in that I didnt have any for a long time. I forgot how awful they feel. when I finally started coming down I dissociated hard like I always have. now I have some errands to run today but every time I think about leaving the house my heart starts racing and Im scared of having another one. I feel like I need a break from socializing for a few days at least","got vaccinated and after a year of staying home I ve been socializing a lot , and I think I underestimated how much my anxiety had gone up and that I needed to take it slow ended up having a bad panic attack for the first time in years .","First panic attack in years after a long time of not having one, now I m scared to leave the house and I do nt know what to do about it.",I had a panic attack in front of my friends and now I m scared to leave the house and I do nt want to take a break from socializing for a few days.,first panic attack in years after catching up with old friends and having a good time. feel like I need a break from socializing for a few days.,0.4050632911392405,0.10389610389610389,0.20253164556962025,0.4634146341463415,0.07499999999999998,0.24390243902439027,0.4473684210526316,0.1081081081081081,0.18421052631578946
"Im looking for some fidgets that are super silent, and dont overstimulate or tire out your hands. Like quiet enough that if youre in a very quiet room with another person noise of using the fidget isnt noticeable. Also being able to use it one handed is preferred so I can do stuff with my other hand while using it. I have a tangle toy Junior with some textured pieces, which is great for stuff where I dont frequently need to use my hands like reading a textbook, but it can be kind of loud in a quiet environment, and also overstimulates my hand if I use it too long. I just took out the textured pieces and maybe that will make it better because it will be smooth, although its considerably shorter. I have a knockoff flippy chain fidget land Noah from Amazon which I loved at first but its kind of loud, and overstimulates and tires out my hands, so Ive been using it less. I also have a fidget spinner ring, but the outside ring broke so its harder to use. I have a metal sensitivity so I got a sterling silver one, which still felt minusculy uncomfortable, but didnt make my skin irritated. I might get another one because it was pretty good, although again made noise, but actually didnt really tire out my hand because I wore it on my index finger and used my thumb to spin it.

I just really need to get this off my chest and I wanted to have something to look back on in the future if I ever get an urge to do these again. I've only been using for about 2 months, but I've gotten to the point where I'm taking anywhere from 80- 140 mg a day.

I had no money and I was in so much pain while I was driving home from work on my lunch break to go do a couple lines. I just started crying while driving because I don't know how I let myself get here. I wanted to call my mom and confess everything, but I knew even she could not help me. I just wanted fast forward time and so I could be clean again. I sat in my boyfriends lap and cried. We then both decided it was definitely time to stop. We have spent probably about 8, 000 ish on pills in the last 2 months. We could have done so much with that money to permanently benefit our lives. It's so crazy that I'm here. We have only been together for 3 months and half the time pretty much we've been addicted. I'm afraid of how quitting will affect our relationship. I'm afraid I'll be boring to him or he will be boring to me. I'm afraid our personalities won't match as well as they do. I'm so in love with him and I don't want any of that to change. I don't know how much the pills affect him and in what way besides our sex life.. It's been a while. Neither of us have any drive while using, so that'll be one thing to look forward to.

Something that happened to me recently. I just moved to a different state to be with my boyfriend. I have met his parents a few times but I still get a little anxious when meeting up with them because they speak very little to no English and I worry about offending them or not coming across correctly.

As soon as we got to the restaurant I got very anxious because I suck at using chopsticks and I have been trying to learn and for whatever reason me not being able to use them makes me feel silly. So I tried to place them in my hand properly and immediately everyone was like you want a fork?? I was like no thank you very much though.

"I don't want to sound dramatic but I need help right now seriously. I have a Master's Degree in Exceptional Education and was able to do a lot of my work on campus instead of a structured practicum and internship. I just started in my first position at a school as a one on one para and then was switched to an ESE classroom where most of the kids are autistic. My daughter is profoundly autistic and is nonverbal. I have suspected that I have Asperger's for 5 years at this point but I have not been formally diagnosed because as a rule I am good at passing but when I am around just one teacher all day I found that they were ""complaining""about me to the principal. Long story short I was in a hurry and damaged the hell out of a coworker's car. I left a note with ALL of my contact info and IMPLORED the person to call me as soon as possible. The coworker went to our school deputy rather than talk to me or call me. The deputy got bitchy because I said I was WORKING and that I would meet with her later. He accosted me on the ramp 3 hours later when one of my students started having a HUGE meltdown and said couldn't I just wait for this other aide and blah blah. I told him no and said AGAIN that I would meet with her AS SOON as I could. I saw her about 10 minutes later and apologized profusely. This was only the second conversation I had had with her as the first one was her berating me for not grabbing one of her students who is an eloper and saying how she has a torn hamstring. I am pretty sure my eyes glazed over- anyway her and the other gossipy bitches who are assistants seemed to dislike me from the word go- seriously. About a week ago my daughter began getting dropped off at the ramp after school ended and this seemed to soften the aides up as at least they stopped glowering at me and pretended to smile. Well I fucked up though with the car accident- even though I called my insurance company admitted full liability, apologized, and explained the deputy for the school obviously thought that because I have fucking trouble making eye contact and i mumble and get nervous around cops that obviously I maliciously crashed this bitch's car or plotted to get away with it even though I gave her my phone number and full name and my disabled kid gets dropped off on the ramp there. Apparently that was not enough for deputy dickhead and he wanted me fired. The principal calls me in at this point I have only been there 8 weeks and says they are letting me go and that there have been ""numerous""complaints. Again not actually telling me anything and then saying she will write me a reference letter and that I am not fired and that she thinks I will be a good teacher even though I am apparently a sucky assistant and awful person. What bugs me is that when i am around these 20- 70 year old women I cannot hide my ASD symptoms. I have no diagnosis but I know I am on the spectrum. I feel that it would benefit me to get a diagnosis just so I can fucking stop feeling inadequate to NT people who are socially adroit while my nerdy self is more comfortable on the computer and talking to the KIDS about minecraft, zombies, etc. In other jobs with primarily men tech support, sales, construction offices I have been fine. Even when there is a balance of men- women I am fine but this almost all female environment- there were 2 male teachers, the ISS guy, the coach, and the new deputy was a man but ALL the office staff are women, the teachers I worked with were women. I almost hate to say it but women are so BITCHY! Am I fucked? Should I try a new career? Look for jobs at high schools and middle schools where there are more male staff members? Also why didn't the coworker JUST CALL ME? Why want me fired? The damage will be fixed. It just seems like she has a grudge now. This all happened Wednesday Thrusday BTW and I have an appointment with a counselor on Monday. EDIT",Should I change professions or just get a formal diagnosis so when this petty shit happens I am protected by the law because verily even when I get another position I am sure that I will be ostracized because I do n't play Bunco or compliment everyone on their clothes . Also I really did learn from the mistakes I made such as not making time to talk to the teachers I was working under and being too enthusiastic or asking a question when they were busy .,"I fucked up at work and now the school is letting me go even though I apologized profusely to the principal and told her I would meet with her as soon as possible to get a reference letter and that I will be a good teacher.

"Hello, This is rather long. I feel awful now typing so please no judgement. I suffer from really bad anxiety and have been for years. Long story short, I also have an alcohol problem where I like to drink too much which in turn causes me to become very emotional. I have this friend. I've known him for a year and he is what you would consider 'sketchy.' He got off hard drugs 2 years ago and probably still has those demons haunting him as well. Anyway, he is a pothead and very mellow, in slow gear and i'm very energetic and excitable this is important as to why I got started doing what I did Anyway, this causes a lot of strife between us. Recently he introduced me to cocaine. I've always been curious and he's always had that urge to do it again. Horrible combo. So, a few days ago I wasted 300 on coke because I basically had that money as a gift. I only did about 170 WITH 2 other friends and basically felt horrible. I felt like I never wanted to see it again in my life and threw out the remaining 180 or so. My friend flipped out and said I was crazy. I just didn't want to be around it and the only way I was sure none of us were getting it is if I ruined it. Needless to say the coke binge kind of put me in a horrible space anxiety wise. I feel awful for what I did and only thankful it stopped there. I'm scared to death I'll try to get it again somehow because I always want a few bumps when I'm drinking and drinking is a thing for me since it calms my anxiety. It's a vicious cycle. I'm wondering If anyone has any tips on how to help yourself get through dependance and if I should try to stay away from this friend because this shit happens when i'm around him and I can't see any other way around it","Panic attack and major anxiety episode after minor coke binge , threw out coke , friend is pissed and said I was crazy even though I did it just because I never wanted the chance of me rethinking my choice or him using .

"Thank you. I had to yesterday in order to get the thanksgiving food, and that was for my family. It was unique in that I went out unshowered, ungroomed, just to get it done, because the time and energy and overthinking of preparing myself to leave and look presentable takes a lot out of me. Well, I used to have a life where I went out daily, not that long ago. I got physically ill, housebound, and the mental illness spiraled. At this point I guess its hard to imagine due to a host of issues I need to work out in therapy. I feel extremely worthless. Making friends would be good but I dont see it happening in my area. I live in a very shallow, bougie area I worked my way into for kids to go to a good school. I dont fit in.

"I spent forever trying to pick a therapist I imagined I would be comfortable with. When I finally picked someone I didnt realize until in session that they were a psychiatrist. Not a problem, I think meds would be good for me my dad and brother both do well with them The first meeting went okay, I was uncomfortable and stretched the truth a little but thats normal for me. The second meeting they ask me if Im okay with meds again. I say yes, just like I did before, then they ask how my life has been since we last spoke. Well, the last two weeks happen to have been the best two weeks Ive had in years. I was doing well. I still had panic attacks, I still thought about killing myself even when I was doing things that made me happy, and I still had my anxiety keeping my stomach upset 24 7. But I didnt tell them that, I told them it was a good two weeks- because comparatively it WAS. They basically listen to me for a few minutes and then talk about how I dont seem like I need medication, and maybe this could be the last time seeing me. I was really shocked. It felt terrible, like I was being told I had come to a psychiatrist for nothing and was wasting their time. I expressed that I dont think Im okay I just was doing relatively well recently. They spoke a lot more and honestly I just zoned them out, I was trying not to sob and just reeling in my head thinking that all of these problems Im having must not be real or not serious because a professional has just told me Im basically fine. We finished and I left still shocked. I cried a lot, toiled over it in my head, and after a few hours of planning what I needed to say I emailed them. Basically it said that I had been uncomfortable with them which I am and because of that I wasnt being truthful and wanted to speak to them again. They replied today saying that the only reason I should be seeking them out is if Im looking to get medication. I AM, and I felt like I had said that a couple times. I dont know why they didnt speak about that more if that was what the sole purpose was. Im worried that at this point they think Im faking things for drugs? If you got to this point, bless you, and Id like to ask, should I just try to find another therapist and psychiatrist? Im thinking I may want to see both, but separate like my brother . Im definitely not going to see this one again Im way too uncomfortable at this point but part of me feels like I was already told I dont need the help and going to see someone else may just be wasting their time. Plus I would lose it if I went through all this stress of trying to tell someone some of what I hate about myself again only to have them tell me Im at a good stopping point for therapy",I m uncomfortable with the psychiatrist I met and so I was nt truthful about how poorly I m doing .

"So I live in Japan where ADHD isn't really a huge thing people know about. They don't realize it's a mental condition, other than doctors of course. To clarify I've been diagnosed with ADHD and have been doing my best to cope with the medication here Adderall is illegal here, alone with Vyvanse, Ritalin, etc. I was on Adderall and now I'm on Concerta, which is meh but it's better than when I'm not on anything Lately some people in at my workplace have been going to Cognitive Science Seminars or something along those lines that have to do with how the brain works for business , and I guess a part of it ADHD came up in how the brain works for those who have it toward business. Well, they showed the hyper- focus aspect and called it ""the genius disorder"". So this one guys that I was kinda cool with friend- wise is going around saying ""I have ADHD because I sometimes can't pay attention to people. That means I'm a genius "". At first I thought he was joking, but he keeps telling everyone that he has ADHD and then adds later on that ADHD is a genius disorder. As someone who is STRUGGLING with ADHD and wishes to NOT have it, it really pisses me off that he takes the ""good""part of ADHD and doesn't have to have any bad, and then he spreads to everyone he meets that its the genius disorder, so people think its a great thing to have ADHD, have a little bit of the symptoms which obviously everyone has some sort of level , and then everyone has ADHD and it's all- the- rage. When he told me the second time, I asked him ""when were you diagnosed?""and he was like ""nah, I just know I have it.""Then I told him ""I can introduce you to my doctor?""and he said ""No, its ok, it doesnt bother me, I like it"".

"CW rape Hello all, So in college I went to a bar with a friend because we were meeting up with a few others. We ended up running into a guy we knew, but apparently everyone else in the group had already changed locations. The guy bought me a drink and when we came back from the bar, the other friend had left. He gripped my arm and started making out at me, really. I wasn't kissing back. Eventually we went back to his place and I was not into it at all and I didn't know how to say no because I didn't want him to talk bad about me? But clearly I was just not into it because I wasn't responsive. I disassociated so he was like, ""this isn't doing it for me, why don't you do X"". I thought, if that's how I can leave and get out of this situation then okay I guess. But the way he touched me was like he was taking something from me and he was owed something. I remember thinking, ""this is the worst experience of my life.""Nothing about it was a two- way street. I was basically just an object to him. I still have nightmares about it. I was also thought, okay, I slept with this reasonably attractive frat guy that I should've liked, but instead I didn't want it, I felt icky, and I wanted to cry the entire time there must be something wrong with me. So I thought, well maybe I'm just gay? so I came out and I mean, I am definitely at least bi, but I digress. So I have this best friend who I adore. I love him, I really do. I kissed him before all this and it was fine, I enjoyed it. Then the other night my friend tried to kiss me again I had said I wanted to make out with him but as soon as he tried to kiss me I freaked out and pushed him away, because just him trying to kiss me scared me and made me think of the frat boy. I said, ""oh my god I'm sorry it's my fault! ""then we ended up falling asleep in his bed and he cuddled me all night. I love him so that was nice. The thing is I think he loves me to and probably isn't going to act on it because he thinks I like women, but I do like him, and I am attracted to him to a degree. I just cannot think of having sex with him. I can't even think about it because I shut down. I'm just confused because, I would absolutely date him, but I am not going to date him if I can't be normal when we kiss and I can't even imagine having sex. I don't really know if I am gay or if my sexual trauma is just really bad. I don't even know how to start processing this. I'm mostly just confused and sad about the entire situation","I 'm in love with my best friend , but I ca n't date him because I was raped and can not imagine having sex with a guy and could n't even kiss him because it reminded me of my rapist .

"first off, please tell me if there's a better subreddit for me to go to. i don't use reddit very often at all, and i know the boards can get pretty specific. anyway. my mom was never officially diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but she hits basically every tick mark for it, and ignores her mental health in favor of denial and substance abuse. i'm the oldest sibling of threewe've all suffered through abuse from our mom, mostly verbal amp emotional. she also extended this treatment to my father. the good news we're all adults now, my parents divorce is finalized, and we're more or less estranged from mom now. we're at different places in our own recovery. now to the point when i started birth control pills, my mom let it slip that i was conceived because ""antibiotics make your birth control less effective"". I've spent the past 8ish years believing I was an accident. today, my dad told me it's worse, actually! while my parents wanted to have kids, my dad wanted to wait until he had finished college. I think they were 23ish at this time. their marriage was troubled from the start, and my mom, fearing an early divorce, stopped taking her bc pills, without my father's knowledge, in order to get pregnant and ""save the marriage""rather, prevent him from leaving . unfortunately, it worked. my dad stayed married to my mom despite the 25 years of abusive bullshit to come because he feared for my safety. my maternal great grandpa sexually abused my mom as a child. my mom was also clearly abusive. her family does not exactly treat one another well. during my parents divorce, I wished I had just never been born or been aborted to save my dad a quarter of a lifetime of suffering. now I still feel that way! and I feel so disgusting and wrong! recently, I've had trouble with my insurance, so I visited a Planned Parenthood for healthcare in the interim. they asked me many questions since it was my first visit, and a handful of them focused on if someone had ever tried to get me pregnant without my consentnot just actively violent assault, but sabotaging condoms, birth control pills, etc. it breaks my heart to know my dad basically had that done to him. it's not quite the same, but it's not entirely different, either. a baby shouldn't be used to control your spouse it makes me feel very sad. i know my dad loves me, and he never, ever regrets having me and my brothers, and he loves us more than life itself. i can't quite figure out how to reconcile this feeling, though. does anyone have resources for this sort of thing? i don't know where to start.

"Hi Reddit, I'm a long time lurker of Reddit and I am needing some external advice for how to help my brother. Perhaps in a way I also just want to rant a little. Sorry will be a long post To give you context we are in Australia, my brother is 29, reclusive guy who works shift work. He barely scrapes by at work- passed up for promotions because he just doesn't try. He has minimal friends I would only say 1 and he sees him practically once a year he dislikes small talk and sees no point in it. He is also incredibly shy. Was bullied through highschool and primary school I'm younger than him 27 My father passed away 3 years ago of lung cancer smoked like a chimney , and mother was diagnosed 2 years ago with stage 4 lung cancer never smoked in life He has seen a psychologist when my dad passed and had seemed to improve with taking up hobbies , exercising etc. Upon my mums diagnosis he seems to have gone backwards. To make things worse he has told me the psychologist said she wouldn't have actually diagnosed him as depressed saying he was just unable to be happy?? He has reached out to me, saying once mum and dad are gone, he's ready to end it all, he has no motivation for work, he said exercising just holds no appeal, new hobbies just don't hold his interest. He said once I'm married and settled he will truly be alone. I'm scared for him and have offered to exercise with him, go to the doctors with him. I invite him to meet my friends for boardgames meals movies and whilst he will go , he often reverts to looking at his phone and being silent. Basically unless I harass him he is unable to muster the motivation to do things. In many ways I can only help him so much I really want to help him but I don't know what else I can do.

"I 22F started taking prozac for the first time about 4 years ago. My anxiety was impacting my life and leading me into a depression spiral. I took it for 18 months. At that point I felt it was time to stop taking it. I know that at least in part this was due to my parents constantly asking me if ""I really needed it.""So I stopped taking it. About 6- 8 months later ther anxiety was back and seemed worse than ever. So back to the prozac I went. I took it again for about 18 months and then the cycle continued. After 18 months and being asked if ""i really needed it""and actually feeling better I stopped taking it again. Here we are 8 months later and I finally went to see a psychiatrist and she suggested I go back on it again since my anxiety has gotten out of control again. Let me be clear, I have no problem with prozac or any other similar medications and I have never had any negative side effects. I just worry that I will be relying on Prozac to keep me ""sane""my whole life. I know I shouldn't feel like this is a failure on my part. I take a thyroid pill every day and will continue doing so for my entire life and I have no problem with that well, that kind of bothers me too, but I don't really have an option on that one , but the idea of taking prozac indefinitely really bums me out.

I guess I was just wondering if any of you have the same fears reservations","going back on Prozac for the third round and am worried I will be taking it forever .

"So I started taking Prozac about 3 months ago and my depression has been well controlled. I've only have a few days where I've felt depressed and it hasn't been that horrible, crushing, everyone- go- away depression that lasted for 3 or 4 days every week or two that I experienced before medication. But lately, I've been having dreams in which I experience that severe depression and it's so real. I woke up crying the other night from one of these dreams. I have never contemplated suicide and the other day I had a dream that I was standing at the edge of a building's roof, crying, ready to jump about 100 feet. I never had these dreams when I was depressed in real life. It's great that I don't have to deal with my depression during the day, but it sucks that I have to deal with it at night.

"I've been coping with anxiety for most of my life I'm 24 . I definitely have ups and down, too. Sometimes I can compartmentalize and only feel nauseous before after important things, as well, but for a while I'd feel sick throughout. I found that telling people about my anxiety helps me overall. My friends and family know about it. I feel that it's easier to get over a panic attack when I let my friends know, rather than trying to secretly get past it all on my own.

People say it gets better, and I guess it does for some people. It sure doesn't for others. I'm sick of hoping, and I'm sick of people saying it'll be OK. It already isn't. Positive thinking is important, but I think it's led me to feeling entitled more than empowered, which leads to frustration and bitterness, which is not positive.

And while I'm paying attention to now , sometimes it's not that bad. Then I think that maybe the next moment won't be that bad either. A lot of the time I turn out to be right. And that gives me a little bit of vague hope that feels real and not clich. Also a lot of the time right now just sucks. Sometimes my back hurts. I don't want to live. But I've learned that anxiety is almost always about the future, and if I'm really paying attention to now , the anxiety usually isn't there.

"Over the last couple of years ive been gradually taking more adderell in the hopes that it will allow me to focus and get through college. it's been a real struggle forcing myself to take it because it causes major eating binges. if i'm on it continuously i can go days without being hungry and being of already lean body structure i really cant go that long without food. When i started community college i refused to return back onto my medication regiment because i felt that eventually in my life im gonna be in a position where i wont need it, and i don't want to grow into such a heavy dependence that i wont be able to function without my meds.

Since I was still semi- anxious, I didnt really talk anything besides saying hi, sup, and telling her that its boring being home, that I can be shy, etc, she suggested that I could hang around outside but I didnt know if she could hang with me.

"The major thing in ADHD is that the frontal lobe tends to be slightly underdeveloped in the frontal lobe, the part of the brain that controls higher thought planning and regulation and similar . The brain structure difference in major depression disorder is that the limbic system the reward center is underdeveloped. I haven't read anything about lack of endorphins. If you could link, or quote, I could give a run down of exactly what they're saying. Basically, in ADHD, the frontal cortex isn't active enough to reduce the less planned impulses from he rest of the brain, and isn't active enough to make it's own plans while the limbic system is pretty much fine. In depression the limbic system is hindered lowering reward for activities, while the frontal cortex is relatively normal.

"I was diagnosed with a severe GAD in May of 2019, inattentive ADHD in Jan 2020, and severe depression in Feb 2021. 2020 was incredibly hard because of the pandemic but also because of the passing of two family members who I was incredibly close with one from cancer and her spouse because of a broken heart . I didn't realize it, but I had become depressed around July of 2020 when the second family death happened and when I had to push back my student teaching by a semester. The fall semester of school was difficult and I had to push my student teaching back yet again, meaning I wouldn't student teach until August 2021 with a graduation in May 2022. The last few months have been incredibly difficult as I realized how depressed I actually was. I hardly left my bed for two months. I wasn't eating enough and lost weight. I started antidepressants a little over a month ago and have finally been feeling somewhat like myself. I didn't know how much of a fog I was in until I was coming out of it. Anyways, because of how much I was struggling with depression, I have been struggling to do my college work. I tried so hard at the beginning of the semester and was communicating with my professors about how much I was struggling but also how hard I was trying. However, no matter how hard I tried, if I turned in an assignment in even an hour late, it resulted in a zero. The class I'm in is the last class I need before I can student teach, but I soon realized that it would be impossible for me to complete this class because I've been having a hard enough time taking care of myself. Now, onto the good part one of my advisors reached out to me almost two weeks ago and I finally returned her call on Friday. She was the first person to realize how hard I've been trying but that I haven't had enough time to take care of myself so that I can be healthy enough to focus on college. Over the weekend and on Monday, she searched for a way to get me to graduate and she found a major that my course work fit into. I found out Monday night that I get to graduate in just over a month. I've been in college for 5 years. I was incredibly successful for my first 3 years, but once my coping mechanisms stopped working, I started falling apart. I've been trying to keep myself together but I haven't had nearly enough time to focus on taking care of myself. The last year has made graduation seem impossible. I had tried contacting multiple departments on campus to get the help I needed to succeed, but every department responded with ""That's not something we can help with. Try asking xx department.""But. I get to graduate! I am sad that I won't graduate with my teaching degree as I've wanted to be a teacher for as long as I can remember, but I'm graduating with a Bachelor's degree and I can finally take the time I need to take care of myself. I can work in an education related field while taking care of myself. The last few years have had me working two part time jobs, taking college classes, completing unpaid placements in Elementary schools, and trying but failing to take care of my home and myself. Now I only have to work one job that pays more that is in my desired field even though it isn't as a teacher while taking care of myself and my home. I cannot describe how relieved I am to be moving forward again.

"Hello reddit, So a little backstory I have struggled with social anxiety all of my life. Recently, my mother passed away with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and my symptoms have amplified 10 fold. Now I can barely leave the house and whenever I go to the grocery store I feel like I'm going to have a fucking panic attack. I feel like this anxiety depression panic is ruining my life and is keeping me from achieving my goals of going to medical school and furthering my education. So here's the deal I met with a general practitioner family care doctor or whatever you want to call him. I explained to him that I was having nightmares about my mother when she fell into a coma due to the stage 4 cancer, and that my symptoms of depression and anxiety had worsened and we're keeping me from hanging out with my friends, family, or anyone for that matter. The night that my mother passed away, I had to go to the emergency room due to a panic attack where I thought I was going to die. So he prescribed me CELEXA 20 mg once a day. As well as XANAX 0.25 mg 1- 2 tablets at a time, 3 times a day as needed for anxiety and panic attacks. I went back to see him and told him that my general mood had improved and that my thoughts of suicide have gone I believe this is a positive effect due to the CELEXA but I'm not a doctor . I told him, however, that when my panic anxiety attacks kicked in, 0.25 mg XANAX was barely even touching it. I requested that he up my dose to 0.5 mg but he refused. He said that it is a habit- forming drug that tends to be abused. He said I could take two 0.25 mg tablets to achieve a stronger effect. He also gave me a refill for a 30 day supply but that is IT. No more XANAX, just CELEXA once my XANAX runs out. Am I abusing my XANAX or something? Is my doctor being a major asshole that assumes I'm abusing the drug which I am not ? I really feel that taking 0.5- 1 mg of XANAX would benefit me TREMENDOUSLY in my day to day life. Is 1 mg so much to ask for, or is that a very high dose? Or perhaps I should see another doctor, maybe a psychiatrist? Please help reddit. I am in desperate need, and feel like my life is crashing down on me, and my doctor doesn't seem to give a shit. Anyway, sorry for the long post","Mom passed away with stage 4 pancreatic cancer . Anxiety , depression , and panic attacks have shot through the roof .

Not sure if I should just find a new doctor will other doctors feel that I 'm just a druggie that 's doctor shopping ? I tried a 1 mg dose of the XANAX and it worked BEAUTIFULLY . All my anxiety and fears were gone . I was able to go to grocery store , as well as my dental appointments and regular errands .

"Hi r adhd, I've recently suspected strongly that I suffer from ADHD specifically inattentive- type and I am planning on getting thoroughly evaluated for it soon. But looking online, pretty much everything seems to align with my experiences through life. I know self- diagnosis is not reliable but even the thought of it makes me anxious about getting evaluated. I suppose I'm really terrified of being put on meds, because although my inattention procrastination is generally a con, I think it has some net positives like being able to work well under stress and allow me to dip my feet into a bunch of different things that I like. I feel like at my core, those aspects play a large role in who I am and how I function. I have this fear that taking meds will fundamentally change those things about me, and turn me into someone else, because I hold those things as so integral to who I am. From my perspective, it almost feels wrong for me to change my behaviors just so that I fit in better with society and can reach a more conventional sort of success. It just sorta hurts to know that being myself isn't particularly rewarded or incentivized by society. Anyone else have this fear view? Is it irrational?

"Another point related While the relationship is strong is a good time for the ADHD person to get better at this try to take it to a better level anyway . Meaning the most important issues , whatever the most frequent complaints are to work on those as serious and think out of the box as to what might make things better. The understanding and acceptance is one of the most comforting things to have. As time goes on , and when faced with different, more life challenges , it can get strained for the spouse one who feels like the victim who must do all the accommodating.

"I told my parents about my diagnosis almost as soon as it happened. Im 19F and I grew up in a very small, conservative, Christian town. My mom wasnt supportive of the diagnosis, but was supportive that I wanted to get help to get better grades in university. My dad is more difficult to deal with. The first thing he said was Bullshit. My brother 12M has high- functioning autism and struggles with communication was non- verbal until 3 and emotion regulation. My dad is totally fine with accepting that my brother is going to be behind some other kids and that he needs help with school and behaviour. I was trying to talk to my dad earlier about how my ADHD isms arent excuses, but are like my brothers autism isms. Its not about excuses, its about saying that I struggle with certain things because of a disability its pinpointing the problem. He said it was disrespectful to compare my struggles with my brothers, because theyre not the same. I was honestly hoping my dad would understand theyre both disabilities and that they need to be addressed as such. He proceeded to research to find reasons why I might not have adhd. Ive been away 6 hours driving from my parents for school. My roommate 19F and my partner 20M both saw a huge improvement in my studies and were proud of how different my study habits had been. My dad - who only saw 2 failing grades from past terms - said that I am using my ADHD as a crutch. He says I dont prioritize school out of my own will and thats why Ive failed 2 classes.

"I started getting anxiety panic attacks when I was 17 I am 36 now. When it first started happening I thought I was going to die and then I felt like I was going insane. I felt like I was alone and I was the only person on the planet that it was happening to. Back then I didn't have a computer or a smart phone to jump on to and find out about it so I just thought I was alone. I finally met someone when I was 19 who got panic attacks too and I felt a weight lifted off of me, don't get me wrong I still got panic attacks but knowing that I wasn't alone was a huge relief. It wasn't until I was 27 that I finally found a friend who not only got panic attacks too but he had a phd in psychology so he could break things down for me. After being turned down by over 50 therapists and trying all sorts of medications I finally got seen by a therapist on my36th birthday.

"Hi. I met my girlfriend last year through the internet and we've been having an online relationship since then, planning on seeing each other this christmas. Right from the beginning she told me her issues, mainly that her father used to beat her up until her parents separated. The thing is, she hasn't received any kind of support since and her own mother doesn't believe her when she says she wants to kill herself. I don't know how to help her, some days she feels really bad and says she doesn't want to live anymore, that she wants to kill herself, and that makes me cry with her while I tell her that she'll be fine in the future when she stars college next year and can go to a therapist since she doesn't want to go to one in her town. But things are tough and although I really do love her, all of these terrible days make me very depressed, something I'm already in treatment for I was diagnosed last year and I'm on meds and visiting my therapist . I tried to tell her that maybe she needs a friend and isn't really ready for a romantic relationship and I was willing to be her friend but she told me that she wanted me as something more than a friend and that I've been helping her a lot. But then again, she says she doesn't feel anything most of the time and, if she does, it's pretty bad. So I asked her if she felt something with me and she said I made her really happy but I honestly don't know if this is true. I also told her that for us to work out she needs to see a therapist and so she has to go to one as soon as she starts college because there won't be any excuses left then. She told me it was unfair of me to say this but I honestly can't handle being the only one she relies on because her mood often affects mine and, while she recovers impressively quickly after crying, I remain depressed the whole day and sometimes even the next day. I know probably she'll be fine for a week now but it'll come back again after a while and I don't know how to help her or what to do anymore","I do n't know what to do , I love my online girlfriend and I want to go visit her this year but her depression is taking a toll on me and she refuses to get any kind of help .",My girlfriend is depressed and suicidal and I don't know how to help her or what to do anymore.,My girlfriend is depressed and I don't know how to help her or what to do anymore.

"I have been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years now. He has a history of depression, and something that really triggers him is his job. Within the timespan that we were together had has alternated between jobs, leaving toxic bosses, and trying to find better opportunities for himself. I admire this. He however has made some decisions in the past, like quitting his job before having another secure one lined up. This resulted in him being incredibly depressed. This was a really rough patch in the relationship because of the way he handles his depression. The fact that he made a bad judgement call to quit his job really isnt my focus, because he currently is employed. My focus is more upon how whenever he is feeling a lot of tension because of things that touch his life directly- he truly seems to lash out on me. Its almost predicatable at this point if he tells me there is tension inside from feeling disappointed from a work situation, Ill know that an argument will be headed my way. I try my best to be there for him and actively listen. Ive casted out so many efforts to be so mindful upon my word choices, and be incredibly supportive, but he gets so moody. The latest situation involved him telling me his pay wasnt what he thought it would be. He started to tell me that he gives up on life and nothing works out. Being that there is a history of him having suicide attempts I really take this seriously and it triggers some panic attacks. I try to be open and encouraging by saying things like, please dont say you give up. I am here for you. We can work through this. I am trying to acknowledge my own health and do the best to support him.

"Back story. Me and some classmates are in a programming course. Computers have always been my interest and kind of my thing. But there is this girl from class, she gets the things we learn from the course way faster. And it's not like she uses all her life for them, she has a very pronounced social life, she goes to a couple other courses, outside of school and she gets top grades. I sacrificed my social life and in a way my soft side, so I can be as smart as I can, I work so hard, especially for the course, yet she still, after everything else she constantly does better. After the constant curiosity, interest, work and effort she somehow still gets it better than me. I am so bitter. I guess today was the tipping point. There were these exercises we had for homework. She did them in half the time, and with cleaner, shorter and better code than me. I used all my brain power to do them I had a bit of a headache from thinking so hard . Until now I was covering my eyes, because when we had an exam, she did the last the hardest task 100 100, mine was 80 100. I kept saying to myself that it was because the exercise was weird or something, or the result checking software was bad. When I looked at her code, it was way way better.

"For your awareness, I am extremely sarcastic, passive- aggressive, and sardonic right now like most times. I know what I am. I'm divided between if it's from all the negative self- talk and rumination or if everyone really is a lying manipulative sociopath.

I caved in the middle of senior year and got fed an antidepressant that killed my attention span, short- term memory, and took some part of my personality.

I hate myself and I hate who I am and what I have done and who I have become. I 'd rather be dead than be a part of this cycle of negative self - talk and rumination. I know I have the capability of being a sociopath, but it's hard for me to tell if I am a lying manipulative sociopath or if everyone really is a manipulative asshole. If I am the latter, then why do I feel painful empathy toward people? If I was the former, why am I so cold - hearted to people? Why do I care so much about what they think of me? Why is it so hard to just let go of the past and move on with my life? Why am I always so hesitant to confront people with my concerns? I feel stupid for feeling this way because I have nothing to back up my feelings. I make up excuses for myself and feel like an imposter every time I have a problem. I am tired of feeling like this.

"I can't bring myself to do anything. Breakfast etc. takes at least 1, 5 hours because I'll get distracted either watching a show or googling random stuff. Then, instead of doing what I intended, I Google some more, text people, browse Reddit etc. I make todo listst but still. I'm an almost- ex- smoker and smoking was also my go- to postponing moment, but strangely that kinda worked. My mind sounds like listening to 10 radio channels at the same time. I get uncomfortable with people when we don't talk constantly when together. I can't concentrate because it scares me to not think, but at the same time I would absolutely love not thinking for a while. Sometimes my mind is just blank for one day and I love it. Smoking hasj makes my mind work even faster, which I love because I can't focus on those thoughts so it's kind of like not thinking at all. I don't want to smoke that stuff fore more than like once a week. I overthink EVERYTHING. Which makes me depressed, which makes me overthink even more.

"Not sure the best place for this, but at least some of it relates to ADHD so I am sure somebody here has had a similar experience. Official Diagnosis - ADHD with unspecified mood disorders. Doc's pretty sure I have a mood disorder but my symptoms don't really fit any particular thing. Just general anxiety, social issues, stress, very easily irritable, trouble sleeping, and occasional depression. My issue that I am having lately is that I have tried a veritable encyclopedia of medications at various times. SSRI's and other things I don't remember now for mood disorders, and both stimulants and non- stimulants for the ADHD. Have also tried lorazepam and Ambien for sleep to little effect. The only thing that seems to work is alcohol. It's gotten to the point where I drink 2- 3 nights a week just so I can relax be emotionally normal. 4- 6 oz of rum or whiskey seem to be the sweet spot for normalization while still being able to function.

"I grew up with a normal, functioning family. We had money, love, and I had all the friends and girls I could ask for. Then, just like that, my family lost the businesses, my mom got addicted to medications, my brother got hooked on meth and stole everything fro my family, and I started cheating on my serious girlfriend with my best friend. Fast forward to about 4 months ago and everything comes out. We get caught cheating, her fianc kicks her out of the apartment, and I stay with my girlfriend. That's when the depression started. I stopped talking to my best friend to try and work things out with my girlfriend and it just seems like everything that's ever bothered me came to the forefront. I've seen a counselor some, but it didn't do a whole lot. I'm going to see another one soon and am gonna ask about depression medicine. Hope that helps. I'm at a crossroads right now, I have to choose between staying with my girlfriend, or being with my best friend who I cheated with. It depresses me that I have to hurt someone AGAIN. I don't know what to do. I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but from what I've read, all the symptoms are here. I have no motivation to do much of anything, ESPECIALLY not making a life altering decision for several people. I feel trapped. Alone. Stuck. And people's happiness depends on my next move.

"My 22 F boyfriend 21 male is the love of my life. He means everything to me. He has always struggled with his lifes purpose and it often sends him into a spiral of depression and lack of motivation when he feels like hes stuck. We have been together now for 2 years and we live together with an awesome family that includes us and our 3 cats. His mind is telling him that we should break up because he thinks he is going to hurt me. Every night since hes finally expressed this, I come home and I remind him that I love him no matter what and will be here for him til the end because thats what I promised him and I meant it. When I tell him this, after his long day, he always breathes out as a sigh of relief. Almost as if he was hoping to hear this from me. I think all day Im apart from him, his mind is trying to rationalize drifting away because he believes he is not worthy of me since he is going through such a tough time at the moment. But I will always explain to him that he is worthy, and is the one I want to be with. Even if we dont work out for whatever reason, I need him to see that any other future relationship he has he should have someone who will fight for him and love him even during the hard times. I told him that Im not going anywhere unless he verbally breaks up with me and he doesnt really seem like he wants that because he wont say those words. Im not going to force myself into his life if he doesnt want me there, but I can tell he doesnt want me to go. So with that being said, I dont want to try and fix him like so many people say they are trying to do for themselves, or loved ones that struggle with depression. I am trying to let him know that he will be able to restore the ridiculous amount of motivation and need for success that he possesses but has just lost sight of. I want to help him reframe his thought process and help him realize that life has no clear path and that what he is currently doing with it is not wrong. I want to be right by his side so that he can restore his strength that has been lost. I need him to realize that depression is something he has to learn to manage, as hard as it is, because he will most likely always feel depression creep in his whole life. He always looked at happiness like a goal, when in reality its just an emotion that comes and goes. I really really love him and Im not going anywhere if I see that he still wants me around. Im going to fight for him and show him that he is loved. And anyone else who is struggling with depression should also know that people fucking love you. And I know its hard because your mind is trying to talk you out of believing that someone could really still love you even in the state that youre in, the way you are feeling literally nothing, and when you do feel an emotion its sadness or guilt for whatever you think you are doing to your loved one. Dont make any rash decisions on who to kick out of your life when you are in that tunnel vision. People who love you truly, will stay. And if they run at the first sign of trouble, then they never loved you, and thats okay. Tell them good riddance. Now, Heres the hard part.

"Yup! Just got tenured, actually. For me, grad school was like ADHD heaven and hell at the same time. It's a chance to spend years hyperfocusing on something you love! And for the most part I was able to keep my own hours. But, it's also very self- directed and that can be killer. I was very lucky to have an amazing advisor - she provided enough structure to keep me on track, but enough freedom that I could work with my brain instead of against it. Without her I think I would have probably failed hard. I started running into trouble during my post- doc. My ""advisor""was a terrible human being. He'd yank me from project to project, tell me to do something and then later berate me for doing exactly as he asked, tried to set me and the other post- doc against each other but we were both too easygoing so that didn't work, at least , insult my ideas and then later present them as his own. and it was so hard to keep faith in myself because I AM disorganized, I DO forget things, and he totally took advantage of that to gaslight the crap out of me. Still managed to get a tenure- track job even without a letter from him, though it was difficult. I have a really supportive group of coworkers and administration - again, very lucky. But getting my research going and being productive was so, so hard. Too much freedom, so little day- to- day accountability! One of those supportive coworkers was kind enough to sit me down in my fourth year and tell me that if I didn't get my shit together I was risking my tenure case. That's when I finally saw a psychiatrist and got a prescription. It made all the difference. I somehow managed to pull together the threads of all the different directions I'd been spinning and weave them into a reasonable tenure case. It's still fricking hard. I teach, run my research program, oversee student researchers in my lab and on other projects. I say yes to waaaaay too much because shiny new things are always exciting at the start, then end up overwhelmed when I actually have to do all the stuff.

"I for quite a few years believed that I had really bad anxiety, and on some level, I guess I did have it I was always worried about not saying the right thing or being dissatisfied with myself in social situations. I felt like I could never find the right thing to say and I always felt surprised and off- guard when social encounter would unfold suddenly. This caused a lot of dread and anxiety about social situations. However, a couple months back I was diagnosed with ADD due to my troubles with concentrating in the harsh environment of university schooling, I was put on Vyvanse and something really interesting things happened. All of a sudden social situations were manageable, I could predict the flow of conversation and really engage with the dialogue.

"I'm new to this sub, and thought it would be great for me to post the issues i've been having lately. I've learned to not hold it in, and here I am letting it out! I 25F have been in a relationship with this guy 26M for about a month now and we started talking last September. Things are going great for the most part it's a long distance relationship , but I feel my thoughts creeping up on me. I've noticed lately that these thoughts that come up are ridiculous. I'll first wake up feeling very anxious. I feel like i've drank 10 cups of coffee and my mind just starts racing, like it can't stand still. I start to feel like i'm not doing enough for myself and that i'm wasting everyone's time then the thoughts start to flow into the relationship i'm in. I start to think that he's talking to someone else, or that i'm not a priority on his list. He's reassured me plenty of times that I'm the only one and that he hasn't clicked with someone in this way in a long time. But then I start to think that he's just playing it all up these thoughts stem more from when he doesn't text me for awhile. I used to be so reliant on constant texting to keep me happy, but I don't want to go back to that life. I like feeling that I don't need constant communication and my phone to keep me happy. But once these thoughts start to calm down, I look at the big picture. I see that at its core, he hasn't even done anything wrong. I have the independence that i've been wanting. He focuses on his work, and I focus on mine. I start to realize that what i'm feeling is coming from my head. I start to feel like i'm trying to sabotage everything good in my life like I don't deserve anything like this. I talk to my best friends about my anxiety whenever it comes up, but I feel bad nowadays when I do. I feel like i'm wasting their time sounding like a broken record. With my financial situation right now, seeing a therapist isn't really possible, and that's why i'm here. I apologize for my thoughts being all over the place.

"Hello all. I have an anxiety disorder. It is very difficult for me to talk in social situations. I also sweat profusely. I use lots of anti- perspirant such as certain- dri and I also use body powder But this does not stop the constant sweating. It's very hard for me to be comfortable throughout the day with all the stress. I have to constantly stand or else the sweat will soak through my pants. Whenever they are a little more than five people I am unfamiliar with, that I must speak to as a group, I get panic attacks. My heart starts racing, I begin to sweat profusely and I can barely get words out of my mouth. Frequently before any anticipated social situations I throw up and have extreme urges to go to the bathroom. I also feel extremely nauseous the entire time before. I have been struggling with this from 8th grade. I am currently 20 years old and on my parent's healthcare. I've talked to my parents about going to a doctor on numerous occasions. Unfortunately they are against anything medication related which is why I believe they don't want me to get help. I even asked to just talk to a guidance counselor about coping but they refused to help me. It is very frustrating to me because I know they love me but do not understand. They only want to talk to me about it and give me simple advice that I have not had success with. I have had pretty extreme depression and suicidal thoughts throughout high school. I didn't want to tell anyone about my situation because I did not want their pity and I didn't think anyone could help me but myself. During my senior year in high school most of the depression went away and I could finally say that I was happy. With a lot of courage recently I reached out to one of the counselors at my local college to receive some guidance counseling. I found it very helpful but the coping techniques that I learned still did not fully help me get rid of these panic attacks. It seems so foolish of me not to ask help from someone other than my parents. But at the time it did not seem possible for me. Recently I have been offered a job opportunity in salary that would make me financially independent of my parents. I want to take this job opportunity so I can so I can receive help without my parents intervention or knowledge. I shouldn't have to engage in many social situations for the most part.

"Fairly recently I started speaking with a therapist about my excoriation disorder. While doing the standard evaluation of mental health she mentioned that it sounds like my mother might be bi polar, something I had considered often. It wasn't until recently have I considered I may be as well. I have been working to get a grasp on my mental health in hopes of boosting my self esteem. I've always felt pretty disconnected from my body and suffered from massive anxiety which I've managed to get under control for the most part . As I have delved into understanding myself and how I react to things, what tones I use and how I handle situations. I've found I really struggle with going from being ok or happy to being not ok or pissed very quickly. Over the years my OCD has gotten worse but that doesn't really explain how I handle my reactions to the small things. I don't like the person I become, it feels like these small emotions I feel just take control so quickly and I don't get to have a say in how I react to situations.

"Hello everyone. I've been on medication for a little under 2 years and have a great rapport with my doctor. Upon picking up this month's prescription I noticed the pills looked different than usual. After doing a little research, I found out that the manufacturer was different from what I usually get. While doing the aforementioned research, I've come across a lot of troubling posts concerning this manufacturer I'm referring to Aurobindo Pharm . Most of the posts criticized the efficacy of this company's generic Adderall as well as it's less- than- pristine track record regarding their quality control not to mention a plethora of weird side effects . I immediately was very disappointed and concerned for my upcoming month. In fact, right after reading all the posts I could swear I wasn't feeling anything and began feeling a headache coming on placebo is a helluva drug . However, by noon everything equalized and I was back to my usual routine. I'm still interested if all those posts most were 4 years old have any validity to them? I've tried Vyvanse, Sandoz amphetamine combo, Teva amp combo, and now Aurobindo amp combo, and I've gotta say I can't tell any difference besides Vyvvanse obviously . Was the quality control improved over the past few years? Did I get a magic batch of some kind? Or perhaps, there's something else at play here? Does anyone have any recent experience with Aurobindo generic Adderall that could chime in?","I became very concerned with my medication 's manufacturer after reading a ton of posts online , but at the end of the day ca n't really tell if there 's a huge difference or not .",Aurobindo generic Adderall was different from what I usually get and I've seen a lot of negative reviews from 4 years ago.

"Please excuse the throwaway account, I use my other account for professional subs and I don't want the two to be linked together. Also, please excuse the misuse of ""affects""in the title, can't change it now, whoops. Here's the story Finally went a few days ago to a psych and got diagnosed with ADHD primarily inattentive and he prescribed 10mg Adderall IR to be taken twice a day, 4- 6 hours apart. He also told me that I can split the pill to start, if I want to, in order to find out how the drug affects me. So that's what I did yesterday, I took two 5mg doses. It seemed to work very well, after about half an hour I was able to focus and I had very little fatigue compared to the usual. It made all of my ADHD symptoms disappear. I should also note that I did not have any coffee, but I have been drinking 2- 3 cups of coffee a day for months now. Today, I decided to try the 10mg dose, to see if it would be more effective, and to my surprise since it was a larger dose it did not really help me focus, instead the first one didn't really do anything to help me focus and relax, and the second one 5 hours later made me more energetic and unfocused. I did however, have 2 cups of coffee 4 hours after the first pill, because I was getting sleepy and yawning. Also, I had some allergy issues today because of pollen and other allergens in the air, so I took a Claritin in the morning. Has anyone had this happen? Does Adderall caffeine have this kind of affect? Was this because of the allergies lots of histamine? or the Claritin maybe? Would a bump up in the dose cause this?","upped dose from 5 mg to 10 mg , positive affects seemed to disappear , added coffee before taking second dose , now I 'm just super energized and hyper .

"Hard to explain but I 25M have been depressed for as long as I can remember. As of late Ive been isolating all but heres the kicker, anytime I see someone get emotional irl or in a video story I cant help but get incredibly upset. For like thirty seconds to a minute my skin turns to pins and needles, my face contorts and I tear up as if Im going to start bawling which sometimes happens . I cant catch my breath and I think to myself why? This can happen during videos of a soldier reunion visit or an oil pipeline protester yelling at a crowd.

"Ive suffered with anxiety for almost 8 months. It isnt a long time compared to others Ive seen in this sub. Im a 19 year old former chef, this is where my problems with anxiety formed, it Started last January when I had my first panic attack whilst at work, I dont really count that as the actual beginning of my problems because it was a while before the next attack. Im constantly on edge and afraid that something is going to go wrong, stupid things that I know will never happen, like my friends deciding they didnt like me or my girlfriend leaving me. Im afraid of failure and it has caused me to completely breakdown whenever I mess up or do something wrong. Im on antidepressants and I am waiting on a therapy appointment to be made, Im still on a waiting list. I wouldnt normally post this or anything like this but I just decided that I need someone who has suffered the same way as me to give me some personal advice",I m messed up and I want to not be .

"I didn't ever expect myself to be writing a submission to this subreddit. I apologize if this doesn't make any sense or is structured in a confusing way. I'm probably better at structuring school essays than structuring an essay about my feelings, it's difficult. I also want to apologize in advance if this post is a waste of anyone's time. I looked at some other submissions on this board and I doubt i'm anywhere near where they are. I'm unsure if I'm even depressed, but something happened today that really threw me off. I don't know what I'm trying to get out of this submission either. Maybe words of encouragement I guess, idk why anyone would care. I used to have a person I could go to with my concerns, or to vent to. Unfortunately this person I broke up with about a month ago. I won't go into details about it, but we really didn't connect too well. She is young and, as far as I can tell, very ignorant. I only ever went to her with my problems and she did a decent job of making me feel better. She runs a blog, which I still look at from time to time just to see how she's doing. To keep it short, she wrote something that really hurt me. It doesn't help when other people read it and think of me negatively, even if they don't know me. While I probably didn't treat her the best at times, I've never gone out and publicly ruined a persons image. I went to her about it, and told her how what she put upset me, but she just blew me off and told me to forget about her and not look at her blog, even though I looked at it in the first place with the best intentions in mind, because I still care about her well being. Another thing that has me down is the online community i'm apart of. This ties in with the ""ex- girlfriend""as well. To keep it short, we both met in this community and were ""together""for around 10 months. After we stopped talking, I think she went around and talked negatively about me to a lot of people keep in mind these ""people""were mostly teenagers who would do anything to get her attention . I've had a few harassing messages from some members over the months. She was eventually kicked from the community along with several other people for talking negatively behind one of the higher ranking members backs. She then went on to try and take me down with her by telling everyone I was harassing her after she tried to get me to apologize for the 50th time for something that had happened 4 months ago. I think she was faking a panic attack or something through text, it was embarrassing to read. The people in this community are all mostly younger. The people leading it I've known for several years. Basically I don't really feel like I have a place in that community anymore, after all of the racket and ruckus this girl stirred up as she made her exit from the community. That makes me feel a bit down, since I want to be in with these people, but at this point i'm too scared, ashamed, and embarrassed to approach my friends i've known for so long after all of the shit that's happened. I just feel like everyone is silently judging me. Now days, I sit at home and look at reddit videos. I try to muster up the motivation to do some math homework in review for finals, but I can't, even after I look at 3 pages of r videos. I use to game a lot as well, but nothing really enthuses me anymore. Sometimes all I really want is to talk to this girl, even though she was a complete idiot sometimes and extremely self centered and overly sensitive. I don't like going out, only with people whom I trust. I guess i'm introverted. The idea of going on a date with a woman is scary and I would honestly rather die. I'm 21 years old and I feel like i'll never get anywhere in life, never have anyone, and always be the underachiever deadbeat in my family. I've only had one significant other, and I guess it was her. I feel like i'm a child still, everyone sees me as a child and still treats me as such. I've been so down lately that the idea of suicide has become more prevalent in my mind. I know I wouldn't ever get to the point of doing it, but the fact i'm just thinking about it so often lately has scared me. I don't like going to other people with my problems. My dad isn't very good with feelings and often makes me feel worse, and my mother will just tell me to pray to god to make myself feel better, which makes me feel worse and angry since I don't share her ideologies","I feel like a neckbeard , I probably am one , and I do n't know what to do with myself or how to make myself feel better , and I do n't know what I want out of this post or why I made it , really .

"Hey all, Im a registered vet tech in a busy emergency and specialty hospital. I have been there 5 years, first on emergency, then in internal medicine. I was diagnosed with ADHD- inattentive type when I was a child. I have spent the better part of 22 years taking my meds, finding my strategies, and generally doing well. But lately, a manager at work made a comment about me that made me wonder. See, I have a tendency to get hyperfocused on a task at times and not taking into account that I have to do something else right away, such as stopping my charting and calling in a prescription for a client because they told my doctor they are waiting at the pharmacy now. Usually, these things are minor since I know to prioritize patient care above all else. But I noticed sometimes I dont give the same importance to tasks that others might and it has become an issue. For example, I may have a patient that we did an endoscopy on, I recover my patient, try to round the treatment tech, upload the images to the chart, send off the samples, fill meds, double check my patient, put in charges, then flip the room. But another tech complains that I didnt clean the room while I finish my case, and start cleaning for me and then complain to management. Anyway, I had been called into the managers office multiple times due to this. It all came down to communication. So, I try to work on my communication, but coworkers found me constantly checking in annoying. And back to management I went. It was a constant cycle. Finally, I spoke with management about ADHD, what it does to me, how I cope, and how I am willing to relearn strategies but I am not always self aware and sometimes someone needs to tell me to focus or point out I am too focused on a minor task. Management essentially said that I was on my own, and if I couldnt figure out how to deal, maybe this was not the job for me. I countered that I can figure it out, but since I have to find new strategies, I will have to work out what is and isnt working and feedback is helpful. Management said thats not our job and now Im struggling. Has anyone else dealt with trying to come up with new strategies after years of succeeding on older ones? How do you handle being hyper focused on a task while simultaneously needing to juggle everything else going on and not losing focus? What do you do when your brain gets overloaded and shuts down and refuses to work? Also, how do you deal with people that refuse to recognize your disorder as an actual hurdle to overcome?","i am struggling to come up with new strategies to balance being inattentive and hyper focused .

"In 2013, I developed an allergy to ibuprofen and other NSAIDs. I used to be so afraid of taking medicine ever since I was afraid Of developing anaphylaxis. When I went to the allergist, they told me I could take Tylenol, but out of fear I just couldnt. Ever since I developed such fear I couldnt eat a lot of foods and especially couldnt take medicine so whenever I got sick I was too stubborn to take medicine, I usually just suffer through the illness and itll take me awhile to feel better. Fast forward to this past December, I got the flu and it hit hard, I was sick for over a week and was afraid of going to the hospital because Ill have to take medicine. It scared me, that illness really made me realize that Im not living healthy and sometimes I need to take medicine to get better otherwise i could end up in the hospital. Now fast forward to today. I randomly got hit with a fever and a massive headache, it was awful and my mom told me I should take at least Tylenol to get rid of the headache and to lower the fever. I was on the verge of a panic attack because a part of me is still afraid of getting a reaction. But I knew if I dont take it then Ill suffer just like I did a month ago. So I did. I took Tylenol. I was afraid after taking it. My mind went wild. Ive never taken a pain killer in almost 6 years. Usually the reaction would occur an hour after taking the pills. Here I am 3 hours later with my fever going down, and headache subsided. And a long time fear just went away. I might be able to sleep tonight so my body can rest. To me, it feels like a victory, Ive always been afraid of taking medication, Ive turned down a lot of medications over the years whenever I saw my doctor but I guess I gotta change that since all natural may not always work","I had an allergy fear from pain killers , I took Tylenol and never took a pain killer med I almost 6 years , I feel great !

"Hello, Reddit. This is my first post as I'm usually a lurker, but maybe I'm so desperate for help and advice that I overcame the nerves to make this post. For the last year and a half I haven't felt anything like myself. I'm always nervous or on edge. It feels like something in my head is blocking me from being how I was before this crazy anxiety happened. It all started with a MDMA roll gone wrong. Not only was I not relaxed when I took it, but I was with people that I hadn't been around when in that condition. I've only ever taken it twice. The first time was only with my boyfriend and the 2nd time was with him and his friends. The first time was perfectly fine. I was exhausted the next day but no anxiety. The 2nd time however, I was pretty much having a panic attack the whole time. My boyfriend had to take me outside just the 2 of us to calm me down. I haven't touched anything like that ever since, and that was almost 2 years ago at this point. Ever since that one night, I'm always anxious and nervous about everything that I wasn't before. I even had to cut out caffeine because it induces attacks. I feel like I've lost a part of myself because I genuinely love coffee not for the effect but the taste. Don't get me wrong. I've made due with decaf! But that's beside the point. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing, stomach nauseous and thoughts hitting me at a mile a minute. My sleep hasn't been the same either. Finally I made an appointment to get help. I'm not sure why I thought that this would get better with time, but it didnt. Sometimes it gets so bad I just want to cry and scream. My doctor prescribed me with zoloft and he said it would take a while before I noticed any changes in my mentality. He also told me to meet with a therapist once a month. I think the reason I'm writing this is because I dont really have anyone else I can relate to with anxiety. My now husband has it as well but his is more sporadic while mine has been pretty consistent. He knows what to do exactly when I have an attack and I couldnt be more grateful. I didnt tell the doctor about the MDMA part of this but I wonder if I should have. At this point, I do regret it. I hate waking up and feeling scared of everything all the time",After a MDMA trip gone wrong . Anxiety that did nt exist for me before has pretty much taken over my life and I do n't feel like the same person I did before .

After that was over we talked a bit more and I left his apartment. We had exchanged snapchats beforehand, and I sent him a text on snapchat the day after asking how he was. The snapchat didnt go through and it turns out he blocked me. Another day goes by and at this point Im losing my fucking mind because hes all I can think about, so I made a throwaway snapchat and added him. I asked him for closure and what exactly i did wrong. I just wanted to know why, i wouldnt even have been upset if he said he just wasnt interested, since he was out of my league by a lot, but he didnt even fucking respond again. He ghosted me TWICE. Like what the actual fuck? I know where he lives no, im not going to stalk him so I think rationally it would have been better for him to just have responded. Its been a few days and I think Im over it, but Im not sure I can let go",a guy I hooked up with ghosted me twice even after just asking for closure . I m not sure how to move past this .,"I had sex with someone on a dating app, he ghosted me twice, I asked him for closure, he did nt respond, now I m losing my mind and I m not sure if I can let go.","I met a guy on a dating app, he seemed interested in me, I gave him a handjob, he blocked me and did nt respond again.

"Hello SW I have been lurking and reading this subreddit for a long time but not until today have i felt like i need to talk some myself. I've been having a heavy time the last 2 years beginning from nothing. Through the past 2 years things have changed alot, my mother got dumped so we'r in an economic crisis and we booth work our asses off everyday to support our house and her kids, it makes me broke, i have a girlfriend that used to make me happy in any situation but nowdays she never wanna meet. I have one friend that supports me through any time but he isnt always avaible and i feel like i need a change, i've tried working out, going outside alot, trying to look on the bright side of life. However i feel like there is none. I have been constantly thinking of a solution when shit hits the fan, i always think.. whats the worst thing that can happen? i can always just drive off the road on my way home and it ends quick. I dont want to speak to anyone about this, i have been thinking of seeking help but i dont wanna end up as a pill addict that can make things worse. I wanna get better, even tho i dont always feel like it, i just dont know which way to go, i feelt this bad before i met my girlfriend and now that we'r in a crisis, if she left me totally i dont think i'd last, and she is about to. Everyday i just pull on a mask and pretend im happy and great to everyone, i work with support so i talk with alot of people everyday. Next week is my birthday and i've done all i can to hide it, hoping no one will ever notice ive been looking for drugs to mix with alcohol to soothen my emotions, but its hard to come over some where i live","i have the will but not the strength to break out and feel the joy of life again .

"It could be that you're right and there is no difference, but let me try to explain how i interpret this topic. I think what OP means to communicate is the wish to meet an end which isn't truly an end. Instead of dying by way of hanging, or by jumping off high place, OP wishes there to be no ""climax""or ""ending"", just to no longer be Which is literally the definition of the word ""end""but bare with me or have been. I suppose death while sleeping would be the best example. Usually, once you fall asleep you're unaware of yourself until you wake up besides maybe instances of lucid dreaming . You don't remember being conscious in any way while in the deep sleep, it's as if you've ceased to exist for a certain amount of hours, and upon waking up you've ""come back into existence"". And so in theory, if you were to die while in deep sleep, there would be no end, at least none that you were able to discern. Expanding on the idea that OP wishes to no longer be or have been, it may simply be that they wish their family and friends wouldn't have ever known them. Suicide impacts friends and family the most, and ceasing to exist in such a way that they never knew you, as compared to ceasing to exist by way of death, is arguably different. Changing the train of thought for a bit, most would agree that death is scary, and can be painful. It could be that OP simply wishes to be killed in a scenario where he or she would be completely unaware that they were in fact being killed Like dying while sleeping, provided that the act of dying doesn't wake you before brain death occurs . He or she may wish for there not to be an apparent or abrupt ending but rather an unseen, and completely unexpected, end","I believe OP wishes to cease existing entirely . OP does n't want to just die , he or she wants any semblance of his or her existence in the world erased . Thus not leaving family and friends behind to grieve , because , for who would they grieve if OP had n't existed to begin with ? ","It's not that OP wishes to die, it's that he or she wishes there to be no ""climax ""or ""end "", just to no longer be which is literally the definition of the word ""end ""but bare with me or have been.","OP wishes to meet an end which isn't truly an end, and wishes there to be no end, just to no longer be which is literally the definition of the word ""end ""but bare with me or have been.","OP may be wishing to be killed in such a way that he or she would not be able to discern that they were being killed, and thus would cease to exist and never have known their family and friends. Suicide is a painful and potentially life - ending act, but it's certainly not the end of one's life. It's just a means to an end which is not truly an end, and one that leaves the person unaware of their own existence and unaware of the person they have ever been. I think OP means to communicate that they wish there to be no abrupt or abrupt ending to their life, but rather an unexpected, and completely unexpected end. I hope this makes sense, and i hope i've provided a decent enough explanation. I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense, but i'm just trying my best to make sense of it all.",0.30612244897959184,0.08333333333333333,0.2040816326530612,0.2526315789473684,0.04301075268817204,0.1894736842105263,0.27102803738317754,0.04716981132075472,0.14953271028037385

"I hope this is okay to post here. I'm really at a loss. My brother went through a really tough break up about 8 months ago. Really caught him off guard, girl was really awful to him about it. This was the girl he had planned on marrying. Since then he's been on a real downward spiral. Drinking all the time and not just a few drinks but getting loaded to where he can't talk straight. Drives drunk too. Once drove drunk in my dad's truck but sometimes I'm not sure what's true because he likes to pretend he's super drunk when he's not just to get a rise out of me. My oldest sister and I are really worried. Our parents are useless. I tried to talk to my dad about this and he just blamed the ex- girlfriend and kind of shrugged his shoulders like ""I don't know what to do about him either.""If I tell my mom how bad it is, she will just yell at him and make him feel worse. He feels so hopeless, like he'll never get out of this and I wish I could help him see that there is hope but all the drinking is probably making his sadness worse. I sometimes get really angry at him when he drinks and drives which I know isn't helpful either because then he just thinks I hate him. I don't.

"I have had general, and social anxiety, and have suffered with it all my life. This makes work an unseay environment for me, I am very quiet, have a hard time making friends, and never stand up for myself when I should. I am entering my senior year of university and have had multiple internships at this point, some good, some not great. For the summer I have a lab and engineering assistant position for the county I live in, there are several facilities that are part of the water authority in the area that I could have been placed at. I have been at the largest one for the past month and have come to meet a bunch of amazing people that I have grown attached to. Recently they have picked up another intern and have told me I had to swap locations. I got understandably upset after learning who everyone was and starting to get comfortable working there. Not only that but it would add an extra half hour or so to my commute in the morning. After I found out I took a day to gather my thoughts and laid them out as reasons why they should transfer the new intern instead of me. This reasons being I already know the plant and can work on my own without supervision, they would have to train the new employee over again and myself at the new plant would have to be re trained, the drive time, and being upset about leaving so abruptly without being able to say goodbye to the few friends I have made there ect. Today, after being nervous and having anxiety attacks for the past few days, I approached my supervisor in their office and explained my position. She said that I have good reasons and that she would bring it up in the daily meeting, the end result was that I would be staying where I was comfortable working.

"Hello r HealthAnxiety, I have developed some strong HA in the past month. I'm a 27 year old male, 6'2""and 196lb. And it all started with UTI symptoms exactly one month ago and let me tell you, not being able to sleep from going 20 times each night to the toilet for a few days can really mess you up. After it all cleared up a week after I was also diagnosed with varicocele and epididymal cyst, lucky me. Ultrasound showed a simple epididymal cyst and varicocele. I was given antibiotics for the infection and sent on my way, it all should be fine now right? Well as the visit to the urologyst ended he scheduled a CT for me a month from now July 7th and he didn't mention why or what for, he didn't mention suspicions of anything and he didn't mark it as urgent either so it couldn't be something bad, right? Then I started googling my symptoms. Big mistake. Nowadays my symptoms have disappeared minus the varicocele and some diahrrea from the antibiotics however due to my UTI situation I self imposed a no sugar diet for an entire month which combined with my high levels of HA are making me asume that I have some kind of prostate cancer and has made me lose about 5kg in a month. Now, even knowing I'm on a diet I feel as if it shouldn't be as effective and my weight loss is due to something else because it ALWAYS feels like it's something else doesn't it? . I feel lost as to what I will do to cope for the remainder of the month until my CT appointment while thinking about my possibly self inflicted weight loss. And I know that even if my abdominal CT comes clear then I will still think they missed something. It's always the lingering feeling of noth knowing while imagining the worst outcome. I can't talk about this with any of my family members because they are quick to dismiss my worries, probably within reason but it still feels really bad, to the point I keep to myself and cry a bit every couple of nights. I'm aware every symptom I've felt for the past month is so unrelated to eachother to be something specific within the realm of my worst guesses as to what's going on.

"If you're like me and brushing your teeth is absolute mental anguish, there's an app for that! I either skip brushing my teeth entirely because it's not engaging enough, or I spend 15 minutes with a toothbrush hanging out of my mouth as I wander around my house and browse my phone. I already have apps to remind me to drink water, eat, and breathe, so I figured maybe something similar existed for teeth brushing. Apparently developers don't think adults need encouragement to brush their teeth , so the only applications I found were geared towards kids.

"Yep, would still annoy me constantly. I have little monetary issues. I'm not rich or anything, but I have a stable engineering job that pays well, and a house etc. I think I am extremely adaptive. A super shitty situation doesn't get me down as much as it would someone else, but I also don't feel things are great even if they are. Actually I think must people would feel pretty broken about my life situation right now. Me and my gf bought a house 2 years ago. It was really cheap, but parts of it were in a bad condition. We though renovating it and extending it might be fun, so we hired a contractor to do the extension of the house and tear down the shitty parts of it, including the bathroom and laundry room. I'm handy, but I can't build a foundation and house from scratch like that. So we agree on a price of 100k USD and a finished date in the beginning of april. In parallel with this, gf is pregnant. It's planned and all, and the baby is due late april. Looks like everything will go together real well in the end! Nope, fuck that. I have adhd, nothing goes according to plan. The contractor blows the budget completely, leaving us to pay like 130k USD for an extension that's just a shell, because we couldn't pay more. They also insisted on tearing the kitchen down because they had to redo all the electricity there because their electrician wouldn't touch the old electrics. So for the past 7 months, we've had a newborn baby, no bathroom, no laundry room and no kitchen. We rebuilt the entire kitchen over the summer and I've been working during the day and building and renovating at night. Every day, every weekend But it's kind of okay. I don't mind shitting in whats basically a bucket and showering in the garden. I get to make these wacko solutions for our everyday life that make it work until we're done. It's winter now and temperatures are going toward negative celsius and we're not done by far I don't enjoy the situation, and I wish we didnt have to do all of this ourselves. But I also believe this would've wrecked a lot of people completely. The thing is I probably hadn't enjoyed the situation if everything was fine either.

"Hi everyone, Im an adult whos had attention and focus issues for as long as I can remember. My parents were the type who didnt believe in mental illness, so despite my teachers trying to tell my parents they suspected I had ADD or some other type of learning issue, they would refuse to do anything about it. Fast forward to today, I never was able to finish college, have never been able to decide on a career or stay at a job for longer than a year, and I find it difficult to learn new things focus completely on what people tell me. I sucked at all my jobs because I absolutely could not go fast enough or process 100 what I was supposed to be doing. It was so frustrating. People get insulted a lot, especially my partner, because he believes Im choosing not to listen to him. I try to tell him my brain feels scattered and foggy all the time and it has nothing to do with him. I used to love reading but my brain hurts when I try to read more than a page. I also love to write but am only again, able to write maybe a couple sentences at a time. I always make these goals lists that I never fulfill, and its honestly so upsetting. I feel like I was meant to be a successful, motivated person but my brain gets distracted and bogged down all the time. Ive never gotten diagnosed with ADHD or asked about it because I figured my doctors would have known right away. All the doctors Ive seen have told me I have anxiety they also appear suspicious cold when I tell them my symptoms , and Im too anxious to get diagnosed because I feel like theyll think Im trying to cheat the system for drugs. No one in my family has ADHD which also adds to my doubt. We do however have mental illness like schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. How did you guys get diagnosed? Did your doctors just know when you were a kid or did you go to a specialist later?

"Believe it or not, Ive stressed about the same thing before, as I have a similar undiagnosed OCD- ish tic and am currently trying to get a diagnosis for a handful of bizarre and still unexplained nerve related pains. The short answer is that no, clenching does not cause brain damage, or doctors would have made such a simple connection a long time ago and we would be taught from a young age to be careful not to clench for that reason. Clenching can sometimes lead to tightness, though, that can cause weird sensations and occasionally pain in other parts of the body. Its nothing dangerous, but when this is the case finding ways to stop limit clenching usually helps alleviate the symptom. THAT BEING SAID its really, really, REALLY unlikely that clenching straining in the head is causing what youre experiencing, and even if it is, its not a serious cause for concern. If I were in your shoes, Id probably just see my doctor as it could in theory be a more local compressed nerve, which most people get at one point or another and is very benign","I know I m just a stranger on the internet , but I m confident that you do nt have anything serious to worry about","No, clenching does nt cause brain damage, it s not a serious problem, and it s probably nothing to worry about.","No, clenching does nt cause brain damage, and yes, it s probably nothing to worry about as long as it s not something serious.","No, clenching does not cause brain damage, and even if it does, it s probably not a serious enough reason to go to a doctor about.",0.26666666666666666,0.09302325581395349,0.22222222222222224,0.20833333333333334,0.08695652173913043,0.16666666666666666,0.16,0.0,0.16

I was in denial about the validity of ADHD, for a long time I now realize it was due to my own signs and symptoms and my denial that I could actually have a reason behind my perceived ""personality quirks.""I did not get diagnosed until I was 28 years old. After accepting this, I was able to make my life SO MUCH easier. I was able to function prior to the diagnosis, but afterward, I learned ways to make functioning easier and less stressful.

"So I stumbled across some youtube videos that talked about the cause of malocclusion and the change in face structure in relatively recent history. The theory goes that as we have a very soft diet, especially when we're very young, the jaw muscles don't develop properly in childhood and the face develops differently narrow dental arches, crooked teeth, longer face . This makes us more likely to mouth breathe. Just look up the symptoms of mouth breathing on google anxiety, brain fog, tiredness etc . It basically stresses the body, keeps the body in the fight or flight response. Apparently the correct way to breathe is nose breathing with mouth closed, teeth together, tongue to roof of mouth not just the tip of the tongue, say 'nnnnnnngggggg' to feel what its like to have the back of tongue to roof of mouth . This is how people with good facial development breathe all the time Since consciously doing this type of breathing my mental health symptoms anxiety, dp dr, racing thoughts, depression have improved drastically. This has had more of an effect than any diet change, exercise program or nootropic has, and I've only been trying to retrain my breathing for 4 days.

"Hey everybody. I've been lying to my bf and can't tell if this is a holy- shit- you- need- to- tell- someone situation or I am just shitty because I haven't been in my right mind for like a year. Quick history, I've been diagnosed and on and off meds for depression for the last 15 years. Sadly I'm just about to turn 25, or not sadly, whatever. Anyway, my depression and anxiety got really bad summer of 2014. I hadn't been doing much for myself for a couple years in terms of doctors meds. I thought I had a nice, predictable ""oh I feel like shit, sweet, carry on""relationship with my depression, but I was wrong. I started seeing a psychologist counsellor and she referred me to a psychiatrist. Started medication that June. Two medications I had tried before Wellbutrin and Zoloft but not together. I didn't feel much of a difference. Change medicine again in November to something new pristiq . That sucked. I've never felt as suicidal before. I called a suicide hotline it was bad. I got accustomed to it. Felt pretty ok which was a relief, but if I missed a dose I'd go back to suicide town. Come mid January and I have to refill and its 700. Uh, no. I missed about a week and went to the doctor. She gave me a 30 day trial of the generic. When that was done I went to get a refill of the generic and it was 300. Still nope. So I just stopped.It took me a few months to get back to the doctor. I go back I get new medium called vybriid. Fuck that was awful. I felt so anxious I couldn't do anything. I cried getting up for work, I cried on the way to work, I cried during my lunch break, I cried going to bed. I missed work a few days and my bf scolded me that I was going to get fired. Now if you've made it this far, this is where the story gets down to business. I also thank you. I filed for FMLA last September because I'd missed a lot of work since the spring of 2014 and it got approved, so I can have 3 days of protected absences a month. I haven't told him this. So back to the story, I was so ashamed about the imminent need of having to tell him this I bailed. For several days I could pull 2 days of work a week out of my ass but the other 2 I woke up, drove around for a few hours and told him they didn't need me and allowed me to go home. This escalated during the end of August beginning of July. Instead of going and telling him I got off early, I got up, got dressed and ready, drove to a state park and slept in my car every work day for 2 weeks. When I finally realized I'd lost it for a bit I had a meeting with my therapist and she told me to call my psychiatrist as soon as I left her office to talk about stopping the new medication. I did and I did stop it mid July. August was still fucked up for me. I'd still have days where I noped out of work and slept in my car. One of the last days I did that was the beginning of September. I've also been struggling with alcohol issues and I drank a lot on one of those days.

"I am in the process of being diagnosed at age 31, and I have my initial appointment in a little over a week. I have at least a decade of externally coping around coworkers, teachers, etc. focusing completely on work school to the detriment of relationships, home life, balance, personal wellbeing, and everything else and I'm told by the people who see me frequently in those settings that they would never have guessed I might have a problem. I have cultivated a calm outward persona when I am in new situations my strongest wish in life since childhood has been to appear calm! which is incredible taxing, and I usually need a long break or a nap after having to stay calm collected for a period of several hours.

"Hey tldr at the bottom , So first things first, i am not sure if i have sad never got tested but i know that i am akward af, have nearly non existing social skills, am extremly introverted, overthink every little thing and am just bad at trying to get a girl i am a 18yo boy btw So last Saturday there was this big event party where we celebrate that we finished school, it started out alright and i started drinking because of obvious reasons and by the time, the parents started to leave and more and more friends came to the party, i was already pretty damn drunk. Now comes the not that akward part i mean but want to tell you nontheless So yeah at around 11 in the evening two of my female friends came to the party one of them i kind of liked if you know what i mean but because i am an akward fuck nothing happened and she made out with a not so close friend of mine the day prior . This caused me to be pretty bumped out and i made the decision to try and get with the other girl idk why xD . This obviously ended poorly because she as well was pretty drunk and after a few shots we drank together she started vomitting and had to be brought to the hospital fuck my life . After that i was pretty down but tried to enjoy the party nontheless kind of did but Now comes the important part So at about 4 in the morning, the party was over and we all got on a bus the bus was just extremly full what made me really uncomfortable so next to me there was this girl which i thought i have seen before but didnt know the name of. She looked really pretty and instantly catched my eye but instead of talking to her, i just stood there and did nothing Then, the stop came where everybody had to get off the bus. I thought to myself this is the last fucking chance just go and talk to her but thenshe wasnt there anymore I went in the direction of my home with two of my close friends and guess who was just about idk 200- 300 metre before methis girl with two of her friends . So guess what i did i said to myself i shouldnt be such a pussy and ran to her and asked her for her number that alone because i never talked to her is pretty akward . She said she didnt know her number but i should ask my friend because they knew each other and he would give it to meso i said im gonna call her and ran back to my friends not to say my friend kind of forgot to give me the number Now yesterday so two days later i decided to dont give a fuck and write her on snapchat. So i asked her if she was the girl getting asked for her number by a a little bit drunk dude she said that in fact it was her and i said that i just saw the contact and wasnt sure if it was her and that i was the a bit drunk dudethat was yesterdayshe opened it14 hours agofml So","drunk after a party on the way home , ran after a girl , asked just for her number never talked to her , she did nt knew it but said a friend of mine should give it to me , two days later wrote her a snap if it was her , she answered that she was , i wrote again , she opened but did not answer 14 hours ago fuck my fucking life akward as hell So yeah i should not have send a snap the thing with the number alone was too fucking akward ",i was asked for a girl s number by a drunk dude and ran to her and asked her for her number but she did nt give me her number and i ran back to my friends not to say my friend forgot to give me the number and wrote her on snapchat two days later and now i do nt know what to do,I am an akward fuck who does nt know how to talk to a girl because i never talked to her before and now i decided to write her on snapchat and ask her if she was the girl getting asked for her number by a a bit drunk dude she said she was nt but i said i should nt be such a pussy and ask my friend because they knew each other and he would give it to her.

"Today i was making dinner with my brother, because my mother was with her friends, and now she's at her boyfriend's And all of a sudden he says to me ""Hey, did you know mom was actually pregnant two years after i was born? but it just died.""Followed by a shrug. I obviously thought he was playing some sick joke on me like he does a lot, but he kept saying that no it wasn't a joke, and i couldn't believe it. After a while i started to believe it, and i think i went into some kind of shock, because i was just starring into nothingness. After a long while of silence, we finished cooking dinner, my brother asked me if i was okay, and i told him to leave me alone as i ran to my room. When i went to my room i started hyperventilating and crying hysterically, followed by crying laughing out of disbelief for like 10 minutes. I was thinking about why my mother hadn't told us earlier, why nobody had given my possible sister a second thought, or tear. I was thinking about what she would have been like if she hadn't died inside of my mother 19 years ago, and what life would have been like with her. I was thinking about that this could have been possibly one of the many reasons my father killed himself 9 years ago, as he suffered from severe depression. I was wishing that this was all some sick joke my brother took too far, or a screwed up nightmare. I almost passed out from hyperventilating, i wished to pass out and not wake up. The thought of me possibly having a sister still feels so unreal to me, and i know i shouldn't dwell on the past but this was new information, so it makes sense to me that i'd grieve now, as i didn't have the knowledge before. My mom is a manipulative asshole, my father is dead, my brother is stupid, and my whole family tree is even more fucked up. Anyway i wanted to ask if it's reasonable for me to react this way upon hearing this ""News""now","My brother and i was cooking , he tells me that my mother had a miscarriage 19 years ago , and that if that did n't happen , i could 've had an older sister .

"I just told them. But I'd already been through the whole process of explaining a taboo health problem when I got an inflammatory bowel disease and a stoma two years before, so telling the same people that I now had depression was almost easier. I called my family and sent a text to my best friends as soon as I was diagnosed with depression, because I already knew it's better for them to know what's up and be able to support me. I gradually told all my close friends over the next couple of months. I never hid it. What really helped them understand was seeing it 'in action' when I turned to them for help when I really needed it.

That's when they really got it and really started to understand it. Like I said, having opened up about one health issue made it easier to open up about depression - I'd already learnt how great my good friends can be when I need them I'd already crossed that trust boundary and knew I was safe with them. And I'd already found out the benefits of having their support. It's been truly wonderful having them on my side.

"I guess I spaced out on remembering to make an appointment at my regular doctor, so my prescription lapsed. I'd been prescribed a year's worth of fluoxetine, which I asked to be refilled, but my doctor did not tell me I needed to come renew the medication I have been taking for three years can you hear the passive aggression in there? . So some of that is my fault, for sure. However, the pharmacy made it sound like they were talking to my doctor on my behalf. No one ever mentioned ""you have to come in to renew before we can do anything"". It took four phone calls for them to agree to fax my doctor, because apparently no one has been checking all the fancy online portal information they have been sending back and forth. Communication, insurance medical appointments and issues confrontation are definite triggers for me so the situation between the pharmacy and the doctor have not been easy for me. Calling both of them every day and trying to advocate for myself has been anxiety- inducing. Meanwhile, work has been stressful, one of my freelance jobs has really picked up, and I've had to spend several days outside in sunny, 95 heat due to said job. Off the meds, I have been miserable. I have had so much trouble coping with all of this and I launched into a full- on depressive episode. Like, crying in my car on the way to work, staying up until 3am watching TV, eating popcorn for dinner and feeling goddamned horrible. The silver lining? Knowing that the meds have been giving me adequate resources to take care of myself. Knowing that ONCE I SEE MY GOSH DARN DOCTOR I'll be okay.

"For the past year Ive been on an upward spiral in my confidence, overcoming many self- esteem and social anxiety issues to the point where I could just be myself and even recently started talking to women through dating apps. Lately though, Ive been getting a lot of moments of anxiety that make me feel so weak and ashamed of myself. For example, I started a job this week after being unemployed for a year and today when my boss called to ask what Ive done my mind literally went blank even though Id done some much today. Also, the other day one of the girls Im talking to on a dating app asked if she could call me and I got so anxious because Ive never gotten to this point with any girl in my life. Its not so much the initial nerves that Im worried about because Ive faced many fears in the past I consider myself a great public speaker , its the shame I feel for having the moments of intense anxiety that just make me feel so incompetent and unattractive.

"It's weird to type this, since I have never verbalized these thoughts and feelings before. From the beginning I grew up in an extremely sheltered cult- like Christian household with 4 siblings. We were all home- schooled it was well- known that public schools were places where the government could infuse kids with Satanic ideas and principles. We were too poor for private schooling at the time. I did not socialize with ""worldly""kids until I was 16, before that I had about 1 friend at a time who was always from the same crazy sect of Christianity that my family belonged to. At family reunions one of the biggest socialization events I had from ages 1- 12 my older relatives would speak in hushed tones about how my mother was raising a group of social retards which was true , and my cousins never wanted anything to do with me. Not surprisingly, my parents were very dysfunctional. My father was quite abusive during my younger years to me and my mother I am the oldest sibling . My mother would use me as a kind of shield when my dad would yell at her, so I was often dragged, kicking and screaming, into confrontational situations where I absolutely did not belong. I never knew what my parents were so angry about, but I found out years later that my dad was very sexually frustrated with my mom, because she only believed in sex for reproduction. Throughout my childhood and teen years he trained me to believe that sex was the most evil thing in the universe, and I was severely punished if I was ever caught masturbating or in one case looking at porn. I found out later in life that my parents had both been involved in multiple serious affairs. When I was 16 my parents realized that I was not learning anything through homeschooling, due to my mom's attention being diverted to my younger siblings. From 13 onward I was simply given a stack of books to teach myself. To keep the State government from getting involved I was placed in a program that let me take local college courses for free. At this point I began to realize how inept I was at handling social situations, and also how much I had missed out on with schooling. My first year was spent being ""that quiet kid""in the corner of the classroom, trying to absorb as much information as possible. I ended up with B's and A's those first four quarters, which I was very surprised with. My second year at college I found a small handful of students who were also very Christian though not quite as crazy as the brand of Christianity I grew up with . I started going to their Bible studies and became interested in one of the girls who also attended. I had absolutely no idea how to act around girls, especially one I was attracted to. The whole situation turned out horribly, due to me acting creepy out of complete ignorance that no one really understood. I figured I had sinned and isolated myself, which became the first in a cycle of extroversion isolation suicidal thoughts that I have had ever since. I ended up taking a year off college to work a shitty shelf stocking job at a sporting goods store, which I took to escape uncomfortable social situations with my former friends. Once I had worked myself out of my isolated hole, I told my parents that I was ready to go back to college, since I needed two more years of schooling to get my BA. I wanted to get back on track with God which pleased my parents , so they agreed to help me pay to go to a private Bible college. They had actually been setting aside a good deal of money over 20K for several years to help me with this goal. The month before I left for college and while my dad was deployed to Iraq my mom gave my entire college fund away to a man that she was secretly fucking as a ""nest egg"". Not surprisingly he took it and ran, which left me enrolled for college with no money and also very shocked, angry, and confused . My dad was dealing with his own difficulties, including combat during one of the most violent years in the Iraq war. He had it far worse at that point, no doubt. He still wanted me to go to college, so he was able to co- sign on my students loans. I left for college, my dad returned from Iraq, and my family fell to pieces. My younger siblings have all been permanently scarred from the complete chaos that ensued. Surprisingly my parents did not divorce, since Jesus hates divorce, even after multiple affairs come to light. Instead they decided to live out the rest of their miserable years together, with hopes that heaven will be better. In college things were a different shade of depressing. I had a fair number of friends but was typically the ""kind of weird but friendly guy"". The school had rather warped restrictions placed on us, and was also extremely concerned about the sexual purity of the students. It was no secret that a large percentage of the students were there to find a Christian partner which nearly all of them did . Marriage was the only way anyone could get away with even a kiss, so there were a lot of marriages in a short amount of time. I did not, however, have any prospects with the girls at my school. Too much awkwardness and too few selling points. I just let everyone else play their games and concentrated on school. This opened up a whole new can of worms, because after taking a large number of Bible- focused classes I started to see that everything I had known up to that point was bullshit. Our school had some of the top Bible scholars in the US, and they could not reconcile serious questions I was having about my faith. By my last semester I was barely Christian at all, and spent a lot of time secretly getting drunk alone if anyone found out I would have been immediately expelled, no questions asked . I graduated with an extremely overpriced degree in a subject that I no longer had any interest in, no job, no motivation, and no direction. I moved back in with my parents still getting drunk almost every day. My friends from college all got married and ceased all contact with me mostly due to the direction my beliefs had gone . I kept almost everything about my life hidden from them, and stayed in my room all day until I got a new also shitty job. At this point I was a full- fledged atheist with a well developed worldview, though it was and still is very difficult shifting one's life outlook so suddenly and dramatically. Living with very dysfunctional parents who still believed and thought I believed really compounded my stress. I started to make some new friends and started getting into drugs. Lots of drugs. I was gone every weekend and sometimes entire weeks whenever I had enough vacation time at work , and just tried new stuff whenever possible. I never got into heroin or meth, but did a lot of everything else and then some stuff most people have never even heard of . I felt good being around people that didn't really care how awkward I acted, though that was mostly because we were just really fucked up all the time. Plus I started getting some attention from girls, which was completely new to me it has still never gone anywhere, though . After a long year and a half of living a lifestyle of utmost secrecy I moved out of my parent's house to an apartment. The drugs and partying slowed down. I lived alone for a year, with more cycles of extroversion, embarrassment, then isolation. A few months ago my last close buddy and his girlfriend asked if I wanted to move into a house with them. I'd hoped living with good like- minded friends would help me make the final push into social normalcy, which had often seemed so tantalizingly close. Unfortunately that has not been the case, and I think I have just made their living situation awkward. I feel like a third wheel all the time, and the level of friendliness between us has significantly diminished. I recently began staying out late after work, reading in the library or bookstore, just to avoid sitting in the living room watching TV while they wait for me to go to bed so they can make out on the couch. I've started taking on all the overtime possible at work to help with my efforts. I'm scared to drop into friendlessness and isolation again, but it's happening and I don't feel like there's anything I can do. I have no idea where to go after this, either. I am exhausted, I have no motivation, I have no framework to improve my situation, and I the more I think about putting a shotgun to my head, the better I feel. I even bought a box of 12 gauge slugs the other day, which I think would end things pretty quickly to say the least. It's not that I want to die, but I really cannot deal with the pain of being alone much longer. I've come a very long way since I was 12, and most people do not think there's anything unusual about me. But I'm only able to go so far with friendships, then I seal off because I don't want people to see any more. Sorry that was so long winded, I just had to get that off my chest. Any momentary relief is nice","Grew up very sheltered , iffy social skills , depressive , no chance in hell of a relationship , feeling completely empty .

"Ive been through hell with mine. Mine being a he VA hospital system. They sent me home with a diagnosis of anxiety when I had acute viral encephalopathy Twice But I've learned something about doctors, they are simply an entity that deals with things based on their experience and training. People like me who got sick from EBV which turned into CFS ME which has turned into heavy healthal anxiety has been chalked up to a mental health issue. They know no better. Likewise, they have seen me on so many occasions with so many issues yet found none. whereas they deal with patients with every issue under the sun actually happening and those patients don't want the help. What's going to change how to things are seen in the medical community is seeing mental health inna different light. Your ability to go to the ER is an amazing thing in society.

"First thing is don't worry about it! Seriously, a lot of the challenges people face with getting a diagnosis is in getting the support from a mental health team or doctor to arrange for an assessment. That's the part which people can find most stressful. As your mental health team are supporting you in this it means you have very little to worry about so that's really something to be happy about! Seeing the doctor isn't anything to worry about either, they just want to take the chance to meet you so they can fill out the right forms to arrange for the test. Don't stress about it to much, I know you don't know your doctor too well, but there's no pressure, its not like a social situation where people can judge you for being wrong, . The doctor just wants to know what you think so there's no pressure to say the 'right' thing, just tell them what's on your mind. In a nutshell, once I had seen the doctor and they had sent off the right forms, the test for autism was really simple. I did have to wait for a looooong time to go for test as for where i lived there was alot of people already on the waiting list. The test was arranged to take place at a local hospital, it want one id been to before but id checked it out on google maps and discussed it with my family so i didn't have to worry about how i was getting there. So when the day came I went off with my mum and brother to the hospital. I was reeaalllly nervous but it the end it was fine, The people there were really nice and patient. Me, my mum and brother and the two assessors just sat in a room for about four hours and just chatted. They asked me how I felt and thought about things and my mum and brother talked about how I was as a child. It was really easy going and friendly, we had a few laughs and if i needed to take a break for a couple of minutes it was fine. To be honest I was surprised at how easy it is was, normally chatting to people four hours can be really stressful but time just flew by. It took a couple of months later to get the diagnosis in the post which was annoying but by the end of the meeting I'd got a pretty good idea of what the answer was going to be so It wasn't too stressful","Go to GP , have a little chat , In a few months pops over to the hospital and chat with some nice people for a few hours and then go home and have cake while you wait for the postie !

"I was prescribed concerta 36mg almost a month ago after my first visit to a psych. The first few days it worked flawlessly and I knew that it worked because I could actually focus for once. The effect subsided completely after day 3 and I've been experiencing all the negative symptoms since. I'm constantly irritatable angry, kind of depressed, unmotivated, drowsy still get 8hrs of sleep , and have cold hands. I know it's not working because I feel just like I do without the medication. Now onto my next appointment. I want to try vyvanse, but the last time I mentioned it, he was hesitant to start off with it and kind of dismissed the topic by saying concerta ritalin will most likely work for me. I didn't get diagnosed because he said that there's no ""efficient""way of finding out for sure and said the best method is to try medications and if I respond well to continue the treatment. I agreed up until this part. Then after I asked about tolerance he noted that I wouldn't be able to develop tolerance to these type of drugs unless I don't really have ADHD. So I don't know what to really say at my next appointment. I know it's not dosage because I tried taking a few days off and taking double and even triple the dosage I was prescribed.

"I used to be the go- to stoner at parties kickbacks. You know the type- not the life of the party, but always a familiar face. You'd hold down the fort and keep things mellow and fun.

"I've posted this before under another throwaway account, but it got burried. I'm hoping for some insight from an outsider's perspective. I was in a relationship with a buy I met in college for about 4 years. We were very in love, and ended up living together. During our relationship, I became extremely depressed, and also had issues with severe anxiety. That, combined with the stress of us both graduating college and trying to make our way in the real world, had a huge toll on our relationship. We started fighting constantly, and our sex life plummetted. One night, in an attempt to rekindle things, I initiated sex. However, after a few minutes of foreplay, it was obvious neither of us was really in the mood. I said something about how this probably wasn't going to happen, so we should just stop. He seemed to take offense to this, and really wanted us to continue. He kept begging me to let him continue, and I kept telling him I just wasn't into it. He was frustrated and offended, and just begged me to let him keep trying to get me turned on for sex. I finally gave in, and he went down on me for a bit. I still wasn't in the mood for sex though. After a few minutes of oral, he got on top of me and had sex with me. Since I wasn't turned on, it was painful. After a minute or two, I started crying, and just looked away from him until he was done. I DID NOT tell him to stop at any point, because I felt like I shouldn't have stopped him after I was the one to initiate things in an effort to get our sex like back on track. I had thought he would stop when he saw that I was crying, but he didn't. We have talked about that night a few times, and he says the reason he didn't stop when I cried was because I had cried before during or after sex due to my depression issues and he thought this time was no different. I pointed out that he always stopped when I cried before, but didn't this time. He said he thought I would be more upset if we DIDN'T have sex, since the reason I initiated it in the first place was because I was upset that our relationship and sex life were dying. He also said he took it personally that I wasn't turned on, and was upset with me. He's said he feels terrible about the incident. The few friends I've talked to about it thought what he did was an ass- hole move, but they don't think of it as rape. I am unsure of what to think of it, since the lines are so fuzzy.

"Not sure if this is the correct sub to post this, but I don't know where else to post this and I need perspective to motivate me. Just as the title says, I just feel like giving up on everything lately. I am being taken to court because my kids dad is trying to get half custody from me. It's possible he might get it too which terrifies me considering there is an abusive history between he and I. I was recently approved to move into an apartment and will move myself and my children out of my family's house that I have resided in for the last 8 years. This should be exciting news, but now I am stressing over money. I also now can not afford a lawyer for this court date, not to mention the mediation appointments that will cause me to miss work. My job is about to hire someone new, with less experience, and will be paid more than me. I feel trapped in this job now that I am about to move. To add insult to injury, I lost my grandmother a few days ago which used up my remaining PTO which I was saving for the upcoming court date. I feel like this should be an exciting time for my family, but the odds are stacked so far against me and I do not feel like a strong parent right now that can overcome any and all obstacles.

"So yeah. I'm 24, soon to be 25. I live off of SSI. I have been searching for a job for the last five years, to absolutely zero success after being let go from Hostgator, after working there for roughly 4 months. The company I own recently lost nearly all of its clients. My requests for support to help ensure the company remained stable and operational has been pretty much a miserable failure. I have too many people coming after me for me to feel comfortable posting here with my real Reddit account so I created this throwaway account. My efforts to get my life back on track has also been mostly failures for pretty much most of this year. To be honest, I'm frankly not sure what else I can do. I feel like I'm drowning in debt, and my attempts to get my life back on track isn't working. That, and I've got too many people attempting to come after me to the point where I am getting the distinct feeling that I should disappear totally. As in well, you know. Right now, I live at the Bakersfield Rescue Mission in California. I'm also a member of r Bakersfield. But still, I feel as if my efforts to correct the course and, in several Wheel of Time characters' words, to hold the line has been nothing but a failure.

I built my company up from the ground with nothing more than social security income. Amazing, isn't it? When I feel like I'm lost, all I have to do is remind myself that I built my company up from the ground with nothing more than SSI.

"I feel so dumb typing this but basically my memory is the worst, with both good things and bad things. People have to remind me of stories that Im in and sometimes Im so confused. I can see that it hurts people sometimes when I dont remember good times or important conversations we had. These moments are important to me! I dont want to forget them! I specifically have a hard time with fights. The plus side is I get over things easily and rarely hold grudges, but the bad definitely outweighs that. I want to remember things and grow! I can only seem to remember when I say something harsh and out of line, which is probably the one thing Id like to forget. At least I know not to say it again Example I just had a fight with my boyfriend and it came to an amazing resolution where we both had a better understanding of each other. It ended happily. This literally happened a couple hours ago and Im struggling to remember the specifics of it which is AWFUL because I promised him Id improve, and truly meant it! I dont want him to think I dont care because I do, SO MUCH! Hes told me before I have a listening problem but iirc I was pretty focused during this conversation and listened well. I even got emotional during it as we began to come to an understanding because it felt like such a relief to realize what he was thinking while properly explaining my own feelings. I can weirdly say Im happy we had this fight but Im so upset that I cant remember it, especially since it was so recent! Im in my 20s so it shouldnt be an age thing, but my mom also has a bad memory.

"Totally random, last night I was procrastinating my senior paper love getting to anxious to work , and I started thinking about being on the west coast after graduation. I never made many friends here east coast school and the thought moving out to a city after living in the woods for so long has been a bit overwhelming for me. Near the end of May I will be driving across country to California a city I know from flying through it, a place where I know 2 other people that i trust, looking for a job I doubt i can get. So, while putting off my 25 page paper due in 11 hours still don't have a solid topic , I recieved an email from Match.com and started making a free profile. Two hours later I had completed pretty much everything for it and had started browsing through matches to see people i might be able to start relationships with when i get out there. My anxiety stems from a mix between social phobia actual diagnosis and generalized anxiety disorder, and it has prevented me from participating in most forms of social media for the last 4 years all my college years nonetheless . I couldn't do facebook, or twitter, or even something as simple as snapchat. I couldn't even make a linkedin profile for professional reasons. This morning when i woke up i was kind of amazed, i realized that i had skipped over all of the social media crap and made an honest profile, pictures and everything, that exposed what feels like the deeper parts of my being. Even though i was amazed, it put me on edge. But as the day went on i started getting notifications even though its probably a marketing ploy from members that checked out my profile, that sent me emails, even that ""liked""my photos, and it actually started to calm me, even make me smile a bit. I know this has no effect on your life whatsoever, but maybe there is one of you that will read it and just give something similar a try, and benefit from it like i have so far . My only regret is having spent my money on video games so that i cant afford any reasonable subscription haha","I made a Match.com profile even though i have not participated in any social media type things since 2010 , and it has actually made me feel a lot better so far .","I made a free profile on match.com, got notifications from people that checked out my photos and liked my photos, and it started to calm me down and even make me smile a bit.","I made a free social media account for my senior paper and started getting notifications from people that liked my photos, even though it was probably a marketing ploy to get people to like me.","I made an account on Match.com to avoid social media for the past 4 years due to my anxiety, and it actually helped me calm down and get over my fear of interacting with strangers for the first time in a long time.

"Hi. i just made this account for only the purpose to write this post. i need to write out my thoughts and i think this is a good place for it. it will eventually be a long story i don't know yet. amp so over the last 3 years, friends come and friends go. i guess thats normal? but everytime i would let someone more close to me they realise how bad i am and leave me, and i feel empty and like i wasted so much time and energy, well i don't do anything all day anyway but thats beside the point. Currently im having a healthy small amount of friends and im good on how it is. So about 1.5 Years ago there was another girl, she met me while i was doing what i love doing and she was supporting me heavily, so thats how we started to talk. and we slowly grew to eachother, while she was basically obsessed with me it took me a little longer. So for about a year now we have been a couple, but she is living in a different country so we kept it lowkey yet in the last 6 months we really slowly start to make it more official, like i would mention her to my parents amp friends - she could send me a package to my parents and add a gift for my mom etc. Next year she was planning to move closer to me when her contract ends, so we could even eventually move in together, How awesome would that be? That lost boy who struggles in uni and in life in general with this perfect girl. i mean she looks pretty, she is smart the whole package everything i wanted! She is a few years older than me which is not a problem for us anymore really, but that means she is having a decent paying job and i could drop out of university and do some part- time jobs while i would focus on trying more and harder to get into the profession i would love to do without worrying about money or anything. She was always a little shy towards people, not only shy but secretive. She had no social media, nothing. it took me a few weeks to get her into making a random social media account so we can chat. and in the beginning it would be bumpy, where i wouldnt text her for weeks because i was not feeling it and was busy with other stuff, but eventually i we started talking daily, and that means like 12h a day minimum. She was still very secretive and wouldn't trust me at all, because she made bad experiences previously, in the beginning this really bothered me because it starts with really basic information, like her ""full name""or an address so we can exchange some little gifts. to this day she never told me her middle name. She is especially like that when it comes to her family - her dads name? her moms? her siblings? basically nothing. I've seen a few photos but thats it. basically all of her past is a red flag as a topic and i would only get little bits over months and months eventually. Once she told me one of her old names for Instagram and i was googling it and she almost left me forever when i told her. I found one of her best friends IG profiles through that and thats what i told her like 10 sec after i found it, i s2g i wasn't even looking at it properly more like ""ohh so this is her friends profile"". then we had a huge fight and that friends profile was private. I learned my lessons not go check on anything about her past, but it still had me a little worried? was she lying? i mean can i even be sure the things she told me before about her are true? i hope so. amp Fast forward to today, i couldnt sleep all night because i had a bad night so i woke her up for work because we sleep on skype basically together, and it was super cute and nice she told me like 50x that she loves me and she was so cute. she even bought me a nice present yesterday that she won't tell me what it is, and now like a few minutes ago she said she can't do it anymore and i have too many red flags in my believes and behaviour. and it hit me so hard, i talked to her for like 30min and i told her i will wait and be here for her if she wishes. she is bipolar so things like this can happen sometimes but this time it feels different, this felt like she can't bare me anymore, and i know im a bad human who fails with anything he tries no matter how much i fucking try, i just wish i had 1 more day with her. i love her so much, and this is different than the first girl, i was more like young amp stupid before. i've never tried more with anyone ever before, but she said that i shouldn't even have to try because all the things to make me happy she does isnt even trying for her. amp now that she left, i'm not sure when or if she comes back. im so scared, so scared to fall back into this deep dark hole i was before many times. i was actually feeling happy and good with her dispite all the problems i have, because i wasn't alone and lost anymore, she got me she was helping me be better amp i was helping her be better. Im scared that my suicidal thoughts come back, in a time where i now have to make serious life decisions. also my plan to move in with her eventually and not worry about money to pursue what i love is gone. now i have to think about how i will pay for food and rent and everything, while i feel tried but i can't sleep while i feel powerless while doing nothing. Maybe i should just end it for good this time, but im so scared - back in the day i tried little things like cutting myself with a knife in the hand but i couldnt do it i tried so bad but i couldnt , sitting outside the window in a high building thinking about jumping. It is good that i dont have any sleeping pills that i could overdose on right now otherwise this wouldve been the last text maybe. amp i feel a little better writing this all down even if no one will read this. i'm still crying and it won't fix anything. but this is what i used to do last time i had suicidal thoughts i always wrote shit down, and felt a little better. so incase you read this here, thanks for spending so much time of your life to read this. amp",I 'm failing in uni life and just got ditched by my girlfriend while being scared that now my suicidal thoughts come back if she is gone for good . and it seems like anything i do is just failing .,"i met a girl, i fell in love with her but she is bipolar and i do nt know what to do anymore and i feel empty and like i wasted so much time and energy and i can't be happy with her and i have too many red flags in my behaviour and behaviour to be sure she is telling me she loves me and i just ca nt stop thinking about how i'm a piece of shit and how i should just leave her because i do not want to be a burden on her, and i want her to be happy but i do nothing to make her happy and i am not sure how i can make her feel like i am happy when i am so fucking miserable and i've tried so many times before and it just doesn't work. i just want to know if i should leave her or if i can even be sure the things she told me before about her are true.","my girlfriend of 1.5 years is bipolar and i do nt know how to deal with it, i feel like i wasted so much time and energy trying to get to know her and now she wo nt talk to me anymore because she ca nt do it anymore and i feel empty inside.","i met a girl, fell in love with her, talked to her for a year, she said she ca nt do it anymore and i feel like i wasted so much time and energy and i do nt know what to do, i do want her back but i also don't want her to leave me because she is bipolar and i have too many red flags in her past and behaviour. i just want to know if she is lying or not and if i should just let her go because i can't live with myself if she doesn't love me anymore. i feel so stupid for being so attached to a bipolar girl, i just wish i did nt have to put up with her all the time and i wish i could just forget about her and move on with my life and forget about all of this.",0.15813953488372093,0.03755868544600939,0.10232558139534884,0.25531914893617025,0.043478260869565216,0.1702127659574468,0.19689119170984454,0.041884816753926704,0.11398963730569948
"Constantly, I've tried to do well in my academics and make sure my family was stable. I would be balancing between making sure I earnestly learned from my classes and mediating dog fight arguments between my mother, my father, and my older sister. But it's difficult to keep them from ripping their throats apart when your mother calls you a disappointment, your father calls you a failure as a man, and your older sister says that because your younger you have no valid opinion. ""If it were up to me, I would have had you become a doctor or a lawyer.""You should be SOMEBODY, not just some teacher.""You're younger so you don't know anything.""I know it's not all true. Becoming an educator a noble profession if done right, we're just in a broken system. Age doesn't mean you know less, it just means that you haven't had as much time to grow. And I love my family because of who they are, not because of the things they've done to me. But that just makes it all the more heartbreaking every time they look at you and all they see is something they don't want. My motivation in life is to help other people try to be the best person they can be, and I'm trying to become a teacher for that reason. But it's difficult trying to become a teacher. Not because I'm no good at it, I'm in training and still learning, and investing a damn good amount of my time trying to be the best educator I can be. It's because everyone around me doesn't care about what I'm trying to do. I'll say, ""Yeah, I believe as an educator our job's to help society grow. Not a lot of teachers are doing their job, and it's fucking kids up. I want to fix that.""And they'll say, ""You're going to be a great teacher. We need that. So admirable, so respectable.""Yeah, admiration respect. And they say that you're needed but end up just as another warm body in the background. They say you're going to do a great job and set a great example, but no one wants to be around you. Ah fuck, that's what it is. It's because I'm an inept, unsociable piece of shit. Everyone in every setting do the same thing. They say, ""You're a great guy. You do good work. BUT WE JUST DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU .""That explains it. My family, my friends, and my ex all have done the same thing. They say I'm a caring person but someone they don't care to be around. And even if I've hauled ass to be there for them when they're about to off themselves, listened to their problems and sorted it out with them, and 'spent time' with them to make sure THEY weren't alone, it means fuck all since they don't find value in that shit. As soon as they were on their own two feet, they just left me for more sociable people that made them happy. And how can I blame them? Aren't we all suppose to find happiness? How can I blame them for leaving me once my job was done? How do I expect those same people to help me when I'm breaking down every other night when it's just a damn chore being around me? When I'm on my own two feet, I'm as boring a damn wooden log cause my anxiety and lack of socialization make me awkward. When I'm down on the ground, I'm a mess and every time I've reached out I've either gotten a cold calculated response or people stop talking to me completely. And in the end, I can't help but to blame myself for it all. Even if I can blame some of my history, I can't help but to blame myself for not being better from knowing my history, for not trying harder to fix my damn issues. But I'm fucking breaking down guys. I hate myself more for even feeling bad about this shit. It's my fault to end with. Why can't I just push through and ignore it all? I'm mentally pushed to my limit. I don't want to deal with this anymore. Yeah, I hear it gets better. But when everyone tells you that they don't want to be with you, that hope feels dim. I want you all find something so foundational, something so inherent that it cannot be broken, that it keeps you going forever. Some people find it in themselves and some people go to God. I failed with both, so I just want to end it. I'm sure you guys are as tired as me","I realized that even if I 'm doing well in my career , life gets pretty empty when noone around you cares .

"Many of us are on medications in the amphetamine or methylphenidate group, extended release XR or instant release IR , aka short acting SA . Consuming citric acid in most processed foods drinks, think Gatorade or fruit snacks and Vitamin C around the time you take medication, can significantly lessen the therapeutic effects.

"Slight background I've just seen my sleep doctor and I need to stop doing quite so much work at night so I can wake up in the mornings at a decent hour, and that along with my snoring apnea treatment should mean that I'll eventually not feel as shit during the day. The problem is that I live on a relatively busy road down from a shopping centre which means there are often loud noises and sudden ones, at that during the day. It's why I tend to work at night instead. I need the windows open as I live in Queensland, Australia, and it's too damn hot not to. This, unfortunately, makes the road noises even more noticeable. Add to this my reaction to sudden loud noises I have ptsd which has improved yet still remains an issue and daytime work becomes nigh impossible.

"My 16 year old friend has been depressed for a while now because of his abusive parents. It started out as frequent but not daily verbal abuse. I advised him to reach out to the school counselors but they called his parents. This made the parents more abusive. He also told his doctor but nothing much happened. Hes had about 3 or 4 suicide attempts, and gets closer with each one. Ive called the police, and Ive made a CPS report. But all they do is talk to his parents and drop the case. The more he tried to get help, the worse it got. His parents now physically abuse him, choking, punching, jabbing, slapping, etc. The verbal abuse is daily, and theyre pushing him to suicide. He was in a mental hospital for a week, but he came out with PTSD after witnessing his roommate attempt suicide. Also the staff stood by as his parents would yell at him during visits. Now he frequently blanks out and starts shaking. When he got out of the hospital his dad asked him why he hadnt killed himself yet and his mom bought him razors. Hes been in contact with his roommate and hes been giving him advise on effective methods of suicide, and has supplied him drugs to OD on. I dont know what to do.

"Hi r socialanxiety, Not sure this is the best place but gotta start somewhere! I happen not to think of myself as an ugly or rude guy, but anytime I see myself in a mirror I can't help but think I have a very angry- looking face. My eyebrows are tilted towards the center in every expression I have, and I got large, shiny eyes, plus the usual resting bitch mouth. Not to mention I often have a thick, Y- shaped, apparent vein on the forehead. With those features, pretty much all of my facial expression look intense, and I casually hear people say things like 'stop looking at me like that', or 'you're so scary' especially when I'm just sporting an happy smile . I'm beginning to relate this with how hard it has been for me to make friends and it's making me worry about my appearance. Are there some ways to look nicer or at least to damp down my 'scariness'?

"So my older half sister has been an alcoholic for many years. She 53 f is 20 years older than me 33 f and she and her husband of 30 years have been in a codependent alcoholic relationship for a long time. Her two grown children have had difficult relationships with them for some time, and the 21 f daughter is living with my parents her grandparents who pay for everything for her, including college. She will not talk to her mom. Well the shit has been hitting the fan between my sister and I for some time. I told her husband he couldn't come to my wedding 2 years ago. In retaliation, she talked through my entire ceremony and provoked a fight between our dad and I on false pretenses the day after our wedding which ruined part of my honeymoon. That was nearly when I cut her off, but she apologized and I eventually forgave her, or maybe I'm still holding on. I don't know. She refuses to get professional help. She went to a couple alanon bc she only admits that her husband is an alcoholic she thinks she can stop alone meetings but I know she's still drinking occasionally. Her kidneys are on the verge of failing. She said she was sober but I do not believe her. To top it off, My husband and I have been struggling with recurrent miscarriages and seeing what a terrible mom she's become had made me resent her so much as we are struggling to become parents and her kids are so deeply damaged it breaks my heart. 3 months ago I found out her husband had been arrested for punching her son 25 m in the face. She made it seem like this was the best thing that could have happened bc he would get help. Shes a pro at making everything sound great. She's still seeing him! A restraining order is in place by my nephew but she meets him out at local casinos. I told her I didn't want to be in her life as long as her husband was. She didn't like this and made appearances like she might leave him. I later found out that he showed back up in the house and my sister kicked out my nephew. When I did share a small amount about what was going on with me, she went behind my back and said to our dad ""I heard that cookmybook can't have kids.""This upset my dad and is not at all the truth of the situation. Truth is maleable to her. I know she might need help but this has been going on for so long I have nothing else to give and I have blocked her number and deleted her on social media. I am sad to not have her in my life and I know she's sick but if a man punches your child how could that not be enough to leave him? I guess I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. I don't want to regret the end of this relationship if she dies, but I don't know how to be there for here while keeping boundaries. This is just a rant I guess, but I am deeply troubled by the loss of my sister. In my head I treat it like she's already dead and I'm mourning. Is there a better way to do this?

"So, I've had this going on for awhile. I'm in my last year of high school and I'm getting through it. The only thing that stops me is the fact that if I'm left alone with my thoughts I get to the point where I think x person hates me. I don't know if that's social anxiety or whatever but It gets to the point where I get so upset my chest tightens and I don't know what to do around that person anymore.

Those 3 friends are very tight nit and while I'm still in their social circle, I'm only super close to one of them. So, they decide that they are going to organise there on way there and are going to sleep over at this persons house. They didn't tell me this. So while on the logical side of things, it's perfectly OK and it shouldn't be a big deal.

"Today I got home from work around 2pm. I heat myself up a frozen pot pie for lunch because I have only had coffee to eat all day. While the pie was cooking, I decide today is the day I am going to trim the birch tree branch that keeps sagging down and hitting my husbands car. I know I only have 5 minutes, so rather than pull out the electric tools and ladder, I decide using the manual trimmer would be faster. Its just a saw blade on an extension rod. If I had just stopped at the one branch, it would have taken me under 10 minutes, but for some reason I decided today was the day I was going to trim the entire tree, and liberate the stop sign it was encroaching on.

"Hello! I F27, Ontario, Canada was recently diagnosed with ADHD in the spring time and am currently taking 54mg of Concerta. I've found that I can't concentrate, lose focus and the loss of sleep and appetite is clearly catching up to me. However, I'm wondering if any other people experienced a diagnosis like I did. Originally, I was referred to an eating disorder clinic for potential atypical anorexia, but during my assessment, the doctor had me fill out a single sheet questionnaire after what felt like half an hour of discussing my issues with eating, etc. I've also experienced strange smells that aren't present to anyone else in the room and a few instances where the smell is followed by sudden vision loss and nausea that lasts for about a minute which has happened before I started the medication, it just happens more frequently. Unfortunately, every doctor I've mentioned this to has brushed it off or told me to mark it down . I have an appointment booked with my family doctor, I just have a two week wait until I see them. I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences, or if I should seek a second opinion from another doctor. Thank you for your input!

"Also posted in r relationships So a girl my boyfriend dated like four years ago has recently resurfaced and wants to be friends with him. They were good friends before they dated, dated for a couple months, and my boyfriend broke up with her after realizing they didn't work well as a couple and were better as friends. I thought I was okay with them being friends, and neither has ever given me a reason to doubt their intentions. Both say they are over the other. I actually met and got to know her when they were dating but ended up cutting ties at my now boyfriend's request when they broke up cause it was weird. So I did, and she got super hurt and upset about it. But she's even willing to be friends with me now, or at least try to be, in an effort to help me be accepting of her friendship with my boyfriend. I'm scared that if I say yes it'll be in an effort to force myself to be okay with it all, or to make them happy. But the thing that sucks is that I do want to be friends with her, we get along and have similar interests. My boyfriend has always been open about their conversations and we have agreed upon boundaries. I logically know they are both telling the truth, but from an emotional standpoint I can't get past this hangup that if I say okay, I'm letting go of control and putting my complete trust in them both. Especially him. Due to previous relationships failing from cheating and friends who were definitely more than friends, I'm afraid of letting down my guard and getting hurt again. Given the history with my boyfriend we've known each other over 10 years, met online and dated briefly when we first met, then have been friends off and on until last March when we started dating , if he hurt me it would be the most devestating of all my other experiences. He lives with me too, and we have talked a lot about life together. I don't want to be controlling or jealous, but right now I am utterly afraid and jealous.

"I recently opened up to my family and told them about how my older brother sexual abused and raped me. It started early, it was one of my earliest memories and continued until I was about 7 8. I told then all via text because it was what I felt I was able to do. I told them that if they had any similar experience they could open up and talk to me if they wanted to. With that I learned that literally all of my 7 siblings except one have either been sexually abused raped or were an abuser themselves. I've been having a really hard time processing everything I've learned since opening up while finally letting myself process what my brother did to me.

"A bit about my medical history I started showing depressive and self destructive behaviour at around 15 now 28 . I never talked to anyone about it and not very people noticed it, until I finally gathered the courage to see a therapist at about 22. After months of therapy and countless sessions with our countries best psychiastrists, they all concluded that I could try meds. I was opposed to it but the psychiatrists were kind of convincing and well, they are trained professionals. And when I talk about a few doctors, I'm talking about 7 different ones. I started on SSRI's, and eventually I ended up on sipralexa after several years and it helped. I, as most people on here, have had their separate relationships with benzos. I've also been on seroquel for a few years but got off it quite well, very very slow but it worked. I had a lot of relationships in between these years with girls that were actually very understanding and never judged me. The only one opposed was my mom very typical I know but she kept on insisting that I that destroyed myself with alcohol during my uni time. Hell, she probably was right because I drank a lot, and still drink quite a lot but have it really under control. In fact, I have the best therapist ever, who even helped my relationship with my mom. Currently, I'm engaged, and although I have financial fears because it will be expensive, my parents will help. Even if they have to pay everything and we will pay it off to them. But recently something changed. We went on holiday to Crete and I haven't been the same since. Nothing seems to interest me, I don't give a shit about everything. Every day I drive to work I want to drive into a tree and be dead immediately. I know I have no fucking reason.

"Where do I even begin.. my step father has problems with alcohol. He is not dysfunctional. He holds a very stressful executive level management job at a Japanese bank. He is in his mid 50s and heavily overworked. At home, he can become a different person. A couple of years ago he hid a cocaine problem from us for some time. But the chickens came home to roost when he began mixing it with alcohol. His erratic behavior and fights with my mom got out of hand. I ended up getting physical with him and called the cops. That was after countless interventions I tried to have with him about his drugs and drinking habits. He never listened, until that day. Fast forward to today, he claims to not have a problem anymore. I know he has been working on himself. He quit cocaine and hard liquor. But he hasn't quit drinking altogether. I see him drinking wine still. What's the big deal, right? As soon as his lips touch alcohol his personality begins to change like clockwork. Even if he has just one drink he starts to become intense, slurring words, repeating himself countless times, getting loud, abrasive, and makes everyone around uncomfortable. He says drinking wine with dinner is nothing, but sometimes he'll start with one and end up drinking 4- 5 glasses. I've even seen him chug a glass in a hurry.

"I had originally posted this on relationships, my mistake. I'm sorry, this is the proper sub. I'm sorry um, so when I was with my boyfriend, I broke up with him 2 months ago, there were times where I didn't want to have sex but we ended up having it. before we had penis to vagina sex, um. I was a virgin. The first night he stayed over at my place was the first night we kissed. That night we made out and he grinned on me and well, I never had any type of relationship so I didnt know if that was expect so I rolled with it. The first time he gave me oral, I had said no so many times but he still did it anyways. I could have gotten up and left, but I didn't push him away. And I rolled with it cause it didn't feel that bad. Then he fingered me and I rolled with it. The first time we had sex, I said I wanted to. After that, he only came over to have sex. Out of the few times we did it, I had only wanted 3 times. The other times, I always started out with no sex, I don't feel ready yet even though we had it. And he'd always go down on me and then just stick it in me. He'd always pleaded I get in bed with nothing on, but I said no. But he'd end up taking my pants off and I'd sleep with my underwear. One time, I said no sex, and he said okay. And he was on top of me and we were kissing and he was grinding on me. Or so I thought, and I repeated ""no sex, ""and his demeanor changed, ""you mean you don't feel it in you?""Apparently I didn't notice him move my underwear and stick it in me He got kind of sad but since it was in there, I just rolled with it. Another time, he was sleeping over and I woke up to him pulling me towards him, not gentle just like a rough pull. I ask him in a concerned tone, ""L whats wrong?""and he just turned over and fell asleep. That same day, I brought it up and he said he thought I was awake. Um, I just haven't been able to get over this. I didn't want sex then and now I don't think ill ever want it. He was a nice guy. Like if you'd meet him, you'd think he's cool. Charming and charismatic. Smart and funny. So I don't think it was rape at all cause I rolled with it. But I felt dirty then and still do now.

"I went to therapy twice. First for depression, second for clinical anxiety. Depression I was severely depressed so my therapist wanted to help me get through the day to day. We came up with some basic rules since I'm good at following orders. Get out of the house every day. Don't stock up on food to force me to leave and interact with people. Starvation was a good motivator. When I feel strong depressive feeling, write them down, write down why I think I feel them to help me understand the logic Or lack thereof of the feelings. Take my medication SSRI's helped me a lot, Sertraline specifically . Play videogames and talk to friends either online or in person every day, even if I don't enjoy it. Carry out chores and housework. If I feel like hurting myself try running my hands under a hot tap or grasping an ice- cube gently to gain the satisfaction of pain but without any kind of serious damage. These essentially helped me maintain a basic level of normal functionality and made it much easier to grow accustom to my former usual lifestyle. Anxiety I was terrified of 2 things - Sleep and Lectures I'm a Uni student . Maintain good sleep hygiene, no caffeine at night etc Admittedly Im awful at this, but having a good sleep hygiene when I was trying to fix my anxiety disorder was a godsend I was able to get a good nights sleep! . If I can't get thoughts out of my head, write them down and then try to sleep. If I can't sleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something either relaxing or simple for half an hour - I usually made myself a fruit tea and just sat next to the window. For the lecturers part I was involved heavily in a form of CBT to identify and shut down NATs. Negative Automated Thoughts . Essentially I would figure out the justifications in my mind for the anxiety and break it up to make logical sense of it and every time it didn't make logical sense. Over time I was able to identify the NATs before they became an issue and my anxiety lessened over a period of about 6 weeks of treatment. No meds for this one, I just go back and pick out the NATs whenever I'm feeling unusually anxious","I did a lot of things for 2 different conditions that mostly involved recognising the sources of specific feelings of depression or anxiety and trying to justify them , eventually coming to the conclusion that I ca n't .","I've been in therapy twice for depression and clinical anxiety.

"I've got a problem. Actually, quite a lot, but only one I'll mention here. When it comes to socializing, I'm backwards and outlandish - on one hand, I cannot stand casual relationships. People exhaust me and most bore me before I've had 10 minutes to talk to them. On the other, I am freakishly lonely, wanting little more than a voice of familiarity to resonate with mine. I only maintain ""important""relationships, but that leaves autonomous me in a quiet, empty chasm. As a 20 year old female college student, the majority of my classification peers can get so much joy from drama, lunch with friends, little college activities, etc., and I like socialization that is well, not like that. I get rises from talking about the universe, the limitations of conscious human experience and like activities of ambitious intellectual improvement such as studying math theories or solving tough problems . I'm awful in real- time conversation, though, so I shy away from math clubs or other groups because I fear they won't take me seriously when I inevitably screw up my logic while talking to them. I dont want to make a bad representation of myself because I'm so socially inept in person. It's driving me into sadness. A dull, lasting sadness. I can't seem to relate to anyone. I have one social connection the only one, for 2 years now , but he scarcely understands me and admits to it . I'm not mean or at all prissy to other people and I get along very smoothly with anyone - as an acquaintance.

"I have been lurking for a while but finally made a couple posts on r depression. But I think I may have been posting in the wrong place? Ill try to keep this short. I work in medical research and I work a lot. 50 hours a week is the new normal with covid. I am mentally exhausted. I have a terminally ill parent and things are not going well. I live in a different state and I am an only child. I feel so much guilt and emotional turmoil. I have begun having panic attacks that cause me to hyperventilate and eventually pass out. I live with my partner SO of 4 years. My grief depression anxiety triggers them and in turn causes them to lash out at me. I dont blame them, I am sure its exhausting having to deal with me every day. I started seeing a grief therapist because thats the responsible thing to do. I also made an appointment with a psychiatrist. Who only talked to me for 8 minutes and then prescribed me remeron sp? telling me it would help with sleep. But didnt really discuss any other details with me and told me to call back in a month. I saw the side effects and didnt feel comfortable with them I cant afford to sleep a lot with my work schedule and other responsibilities . So I made a second appointment a week later and got a different prescription that I felt more comfortable with Prestiq .

"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about this exact time in 2013. In February this year, I was hospitalized for a week and given the same diagnosis. I was just discharged from the hospital the second time with a diagnosis of Bipolar I. I'm 22 and a senior in college. I have an unsteady relationship with my parents who traveled 800 miles to visit me without telling me, provoking even more anxiety while I was hospitalized. I'm now prescribed 300mg of Lamictal, 300mg of Seroquel, and 3 mg of Klonopin daily. I was admitted at an awful time- the last 2- 3 weeks of the semester. Today will be starting my second full day out of the hospital, and I feel scared. Last night I had a mood swing that almost made me feel psychotic. I don't even know how to describe it other than a day that took me up to the moon and down to the core of the earth, and then back to ground level by night. What happened? I'm also very angry and upset that this runs in my family, that I didn't know until now, and that my parents didn't do anything about it when I was younger. I was never allowed to talk about my ""feelings""or say how I ""felt""so I hate using those words as it makes me feel weak. I'm angry this was passed on to me. Growing up was hard. And I'd only been on the 300mg of Seroquil new med for 2 days before being released. Please, be honest. My professors were notified of my hospitalization as soon as it happened from university officials. I did not let them know I was discharged yet, but I have a meeting in just a couple hours with an advocate to do whatever we can to get me to pass this semester. I've suffered from anxiety throughout my entire life, according to my mom, and I'm terrified to face my fate with school","Was just discharged from the hospital after being taken there by police for Bipolar I , anxiety , and PTSD .

"I lost a job that I enjoyed while I was in the middle of training about a month ago. People told me it wasn't my fault, but I still felt awful. The trainers neglected to inform me of A LOT of things my training schedule, etc. . I'd never been fired before, so I took this pretty hard. I ended up having to stay with my current employer longer I was going to quit . I HATE my job with a fiery passion. It makes me want to tear my hair out. I'm applying for something else, but my current job makes me want to kill people. Its the worst job I've ever had. Could be worse, though, right? I could have no job at all. I had to break it off with my boyfriend shortly after that. I found out he has substance abuse problems. I was in a long term relationship with an addict before him and I couldn't go through that again. I broke up with him on my birthday, which sucked. He told me about his problems after my birthday party while he was still drunk. We ended on good terms, though, and we're still talking. I loved him, though, so this is hard to deal with. Could be worse, though. It could have ended bitterly. Lately, going out with friends has been stressful because I feel like a weirdo in social settings. I always feel like I'm messing up and saying the wrong thing. People always tell me I'm ""quirky, odd, different, etc""too, which doesn't help. I'm so terrified of alienating people MUCH more so than I used to be . It doesn't help that I work with people who are constantly putting each other down and scheming to screw each other over. Putting on about 10 pounds since January hasn't helped my self esteem much either. I was stressed because of everything that's happening so I decided to go out with some old friends yesterday. We had fun, but one of them fell in with the wrong crowd big time. She had a bunch of really shady people over at her house. I'm almost positive one of them stole my iphone. It was a birthday gift from my parents. Could be worse though, right? I could have no friends at all. I could have put on a lot more weight too. I could have shitty parents who didn't remember my birthday. Or for that matter, no parents at all. People always say putting things in perspective makes you feel better, but it isn't working for me. Losing the iphone was the final straw and I cracked and just cried for hours. I'm sick and tired of how people treat each other. I'm tired of the service industry. I'm tired of hating my mediocre life. I'm tired of living with my parents at 25 and having no direction. I had an epiphany and decided I should do something. I started looking into becoming a pediatric nurse a few days ago. I'm nervous about going back to school because a neck injury I have arthritis makes it very difficult for me to sit in chairs for long periods of time and concentrate on reading. My injury is the entire reason I'm not working at a ""normal""job. I'm terrified of being in pain again. I have to try, though","A lot of shitty things happened to me this month .

"I got a job mall cashier a few months ago after applying and getting nowhere for the longest time. I was super excited and happy that I had gotten hired and finally someone took interest in my application. After about two months of working where I am I started to become bitter and almost resentful about the fact that I had gotten the job that I did. I am great full that I even have this job but getting up and going to work kills me, because I know that I am going to be dealing with people that are douches to me and my co workers. The higher ups in the store have hired so many more people that we are constantly training them and then our numbers start to slip and the regular employees have to pick up the slack. I have worked with more people than I see in a day practically. Getting to what I really want to say is, I was happy that I got the job but now after about six months I really detest going to work because I know the fact I am going to be treated like shit by both customers and employees. No matter how much I try to psych myself up about going to work like if I were to say 'yes I have a five hour shift today, I will be out on time today' or 'this will be a quick shift, I'm working with person A and person B today' it never works. I get to the register and when i greet the customers all I can muster up to say to them after they ask me how I am doing, is 'Eh, I'm breathing' but some how people still think I am a pleasant person to be around. And when I look for something better now that i have experience , I get the same old rejection and the position has already been filled emails weeks after I applied for the position.

"I have a friend that I picked up from an abusive household about five years ago. She struggles every single year with her depression. It gets to the point where she can't maintain school or a job. She's failed classes so many times, but keeps going back because she's so set on her mission of being a doctor that she can see no other alternatives. Currently, she is not talking to anyone. I was lucky that she responded to me after days. She hasn't contacted her therapist in weeks. She's stopped going to work and school. Her rent is late. She's done this all before and ended up homeless. She's failed classes more than six times, including before I ever knew her.

I think she needs to get on Social Security Disability benefits since she seems basically unable to function at all long- term. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel like the best thing for her would be to have her committed. She can't hold down a job. She can't pass classes.

"So one day I thought it would be funny to try out one of those spirit board things people use to contact spirits. I asked if anybody was there and it actually started moving. It was weird to me as an atheist and I mostly got dumb answers, and then later it made all sense, because I realized I was subconsciously moving it to what I thought it would be. The weird thing is that I was definitely not giving it push, but yet it had push, as if something was pushing it and I was directing it. The most weird thing, however, is this halfway through I asked can you put a sensation into my hand as a yes, because I hated the slow writing.

"It has come to our attention that there has been some calling- out going on in some posts and some very targeted harassment stemming from these posts. Let me be clear right now about how we as a mod team feel about this If this continues I will personally ban everyone involved. I am dead serious about it, and there will be no appeal for it. This is really not okay. We have all worked hard to make this community a safe and welcoming space for everyone to share their stories, both good and less- good. There will be some fundamental disagreements because of this. That's just part of life, and the appropriate response is to ignore it and move on. You cannot rain on someone's parade, but at the same time you can have a rainy day. Let me explain what I mean by that you are allowed to be happy, but you are also allowed to be sad. What you are not allowed to do is make a post calling out someone posting about a happy or sad time. For example, I might make a post saying ""I hate when my classmates wear revealing clothing.""someone else might post at the same time ""Today was a great day! I wore a tank top and felt so free! ""You are not allowed to post ""the guy that talked about being triggered is a moron""or ""that earlier post about wearing short sleeves is the stupidest and most triggering thing I've ever read.""Because guess what?

"I have been working to change my classic dysfunctional BPD behaviors commonly seen in a relationship. Seeing fearing abandonment around every turn, insecurities, black and white thinking, trust issues, etc. My boyfriend still reacts to things as if I am going to do the old behavior. For a common example of this, during a conversation, he thinks the convo is going down a certain path, or if he thinks I'm upset while talking about something, he then gets preemptively upset and mad about it. This makes me actually upset, and it makes the conversation go in the direction he thought it would, even though I wasn't even trying to talk about whatever it may have been. Or if I want to calmly share my feelings or something like that, he feels defensive and on edge and says ""should I leave""meaning leave the house for a while because he fears I'm going to be a crying, yelling mess, and the convo will devolve into an hours long terrible event, which hasn't happened for a while BTW. Also we live together and then he is basically shut down to listening to me. No matter how calm I am, no matter how many I- statements I use to talk about my feelings, no matter how much i do not blame him for my feelings, he feels like me sharing my insecurities or feelings is an attack or it's going to devolve into an hours long thing. He's now ""trained""essentially to react defensively to the old behavior patterns I would commonly do, and he doesn't think he has to work on it at all.

"I am certainly sympathetic to a notion where death seems preferable to a situation of hopelessness and helplessness. To be clear, I am not one who believes in a hard and fast 100 rule. To me, every situation has specific conditions and every individual is by nature, unique. From a point of discussion, I seek to understand the terms and conditions of when suicide may have more or less justification. In the earlier thread, I was specific to differentiate between younger and older sufferers. Part of that specificity is that those who have NOT yet reached full experiential maturity would lack certain emotional skill sets. In other words, younger people tend to have less emotional maturity, so what may burden a child may not burden an older adult. As you bring up, it is a common sentiment that it is acceptable to ""end one's misery, ""and I respect that individuals should retain a freedom to govern one's destiny. While similar, I do NOT agree that chronic physical suffering is IDENTICAL to chronic emotional suffering. I see an important difference between those who suffer from constant chronic physical suffering when compared to those who suffer from emotional suffering. In many cases not all, but many chronic physical suffering is rooted in an identifiable physical condition that is often corroborated through an independent investigator such as a physician. Additionally, there is often a consensus that all interventions have been exhausted. The only remaining intervention is to offer hospice to make the patient comfortable. In these cases, the emotion of ""hopeless and helpless""can be substantiated nearly to the point of fact. For example an oncology patient may reach a point where known science can do nothing, and the prognosis is corroborated to be poor. Everyone can concur that there is nothing else to do. In many cases of not all, but many of chronic emotional suffering the root of the distress is variable and indeterminate. It is nearly impossible to determine if the changes in neurotransmitters is causal to or consequential of the associated mood disorder for any given individual. It would be difficult to gain consensus from independent investigators that all interventions have been exhausted. In many cases, there are several options for intervention, and the emotions of ""hopeless and helpless""is personally subjective and biased. In other words, one may feel hopeless and helpless, and an independent care provider can offer options to assist. Oftentimes, for those who suffer from chronic emotional suffering reach a point of hopeless and helpless after repeatedly trying all that he or she know to try. Oftentimes the ""trick""is to get the patient to DO things that he or she has NOT thought of trying. In your case, it may be helpful for you to acknowledge that you are living by learning a tenuous balance of several simultaneous emotions. That's a skill that has kept you going. In many ways, even as you are depressed, I'm sure that there are little success of which you should take pride. Honestly even as you suffer, in your heart, clearly there is a kindness that motivates you to aid and support others. From a clinical perspective, we focus on feelings that are negative and we regard negativity as a ""disorder""that may be abnormal and can be ""fixed.""Culturally, we tend to view emotions mood mental in basic emotions. Philosophically, emotions may be viewed differently. Think the difference between having a box of 8 crayons or a box of 128 crayons or a color palate in a computer that can range to millions of light combinations. There's lots of emotions and feelings, but culturally we often get caught up in an awareness of happiness or absence of happiness or depression or absence of depression. For example from your own life. You love your kids. You don't want to hurt them. My guess is that you also have a FEELING of ""duty.""Duty may not be regarded as a classic emotion, but my guess is that you unconsciously feel duty or obligation or responsibility which has run parallel to your depression and your love. Here's another example of the shades and hues of emotion all simultaneously existing Since you love your kids, I'm guessing that if you think back to moments in their lives, you will trigger emotional echoes nostalgia. Some of that nostalgia could be painful or regretful and other moments can trigger happiness and others can trigger a sense of ""bittersweet""or both. You may also feel curiosity or hope or wonder if you think about the future of your children. I'll pause here. I digress too much, and I've begun to lecture. I apologize for the wall of text. Certainly, my intention is to clarify what can be a complex topic. In my experience, if a person can be given options to pursue a path of improvement, anguish diminishes","I agree with you that any person can justify one 's own actions including suicide . In many cases , those who suffer from emotional mental anguish , if given choices to improve would choose improvement over suffering or death . Emotions are complex .

I also recognize that suicide is a personal choice and that you have a right to decide whether or not you want to end your misery. In my view, suicide is not a matter of ""if ""or ""when ""but rather of ""how ""and ""when. I don't think there is a 100 rule when it comes to the criteria for when suicide is appropriate. In addition, I recognize that you may have a duty to protect your loved ones, and that is a responsibility which runs parallel to your depression and your love. I wish you the best of luck and I hope that you can find a way to live a happy and fulfilling life. Thank you for your time and thank you for taking the time to respond to my text. I hope you find comfort in the fact that you are not alone in feeling this way and that there are many other people out there who feel similarly to you.

"I don't really know where else to turn. Obviously I don't have the self- control or the motivation. Long story short, I dated a girl for 2 years. She wasn't okay with me smoking weed, and I told her I quit. I didn't. I smoked behind her back for almost the entire two years, knowing full well it would break her heart if she found out. I even told her I loved her, and I really think I did. I guess weed became my escape from a miserable, depressing and unsuccesful life I was living. And so was she. I kind of always turned to her to make myself happy, and it worked for a little while. But eventually it took its toll. My ridiculously low self confidence and the fact I was lying to her constantly by keeping the weed thing secret made me paranoid. I was jealous of every guy she talked to, every party she went to. She started to feel the pressure of me kind of relying on her for happiness. But despite that all, I did like her a lot. There were certainly great times, times where her and I could just hang out and talk and be ourselves. Well, naturally, everything caught up, and I broke up with her. I didn't tell her about the weed, but I couldn't hide it from her. So naturally, I dumped the best thing I had going for me. I regretted it instantly, but I feel like though she was upset at first, she eventually felt liberated. We talked for a few weeks after, but it fell apart. Now, 5 months later, here's the situation I don't smoke anymore. I'm an EMT going to paramedic school. I lost weight. I'm becoming who I want to be. And all I want, more than anything, is to have her back now. As this new person, who wouldn't be so reliant on her. Who has his own goals and motivations. I can be honest with her now. But last we spoke, it seemed like there was no hope for that. And now, I still find myself checking her facebook and instagram, seeing if there's a new guy. Every time I get a facebook message or text, part of me hopes it's her for whatever reason. I always hope to run into her, and catch up, and suddenly start hitting it off again. And every time this happens, I become miserable. I stay in bed sometimes, I can't make myself get up to clean dishes from 3 days ago. How in the world can I get the fuck over this?","Still hung up about break up after 5 months , still check ex 's facebook and instagram and it ruins me .

"Hi All, This is my first time posting on reddit, but I've found lots of support and soothing by scrolling through this community's posts on bad days so thank you all for that! For some context I've lived with OCD since childhood, but only in the last several months has it severely interfered with my life. At this point, it's mostly contamination- related and practically a full- time job. Sleeping, eating, bathing it all takes hours to accomplish or ends in an emotional meltdown. I'm in therapy and have been for over a decade and am waiting for my upcoming appointment with a new psychiatrist, so I'm covered from a treatment standpoint. I'm fighting compulsions all the time and I know things will improve as I work through treatment, but it will be weeks until all of that truly commences. What I'm really concerned about is my partner. My compulsions are affecting my ability to care for myself these days to the point that he has taken over the lion's share of responsibility, including making all my food for me and doing the laundry. He also bears the brunt of my sobbing meltdowns when I'm stuck in a ritual loop I'm not my best self, to say the least. I'm infinitely grateful and also riddled with guilt. While this arrangement is temporary until I regain some agency, right now we're in the worst of it. Somehow he's managed to be consistently kind and loving through all this, but it's not hard to see that this experience is breaking him down. He is also in therapy, so that's a positive, but we're living in hell. I'm struggling to find gestures of appreciation that I can actually accomplish in the face of my compulsions. For instance, I tried to make him breakfast making scrambled eggs took 2.5 hours. I try to tell him how grateful I am, but that seems paltry in the face of the burden he's carrying. For those of you with supportive partners and or loved ones what has helped you maintain those relationships when things get really gnarly? What have your loved ones found meaningful? For partners loved ones of folks with OCD what do you need the most? What would make you feel appreciated?

"Prior to the internet people communicated face to face, which meant communicating mostly with folks you saw on a regular basis. This had the effect of folks generally being decent with one another since they had to see the other person either through work, school, etc. Fringe opinions and extreme ideas tended to get kept in secret, since face to face communication doesn't lend itself well to conflict. Added to that the average person had no other platform to opine since Time or Life wasn't going to publish anything they wrote and chances are they didn't have anything to write about. The internet particularly social media has allowed folks a platform and it seems this has led to very egotistical outbursts by otherwise average people who have little no power over anything important. The internet also enables people with extreme or fringe views to communicate with one another with very little effort, often reinforcing said views. When it comes to hot button political issues, it's best to keep in mind that most folks discuss them in very general ways, with a severe lack of nuance. Coupled with that, is an increasing dependence by the major American political parties on vague generalities. This has been going on since the early 1970s so it isn't new per se, but it is amplified greatly by the internet. Thus, since the early 1970s, there has been a push by both parties to brand themselves in certain ways by catering to groups they reliably expect to vote for them. For Republicans the push is towards older Americans, extremely religious Americans, southern Americans, and large businesses and the money classes who control those businesses. For Democrats, the push is towards younger Americans, minority Americans, and blue collar workers. Some changes have happened in this time period however, including a push by Republicans towards blue collar workers in rural areas, and by Democrats towards moneyed interests. By and large neither party appears to care much about the substance of their platforms or agendas, provided they garner votes, and the reality is both parties are quite beholden to moneyed interests, more so than they are to any of their other groups of reliable voters","the average person on the internet wants to feel important and largely has very little idea about whatever they are talking about . The major political parties do n't really care about the average person outside of getting your vote , it 's the wealthy and powerful they care about .","The internet has allowed people with extreme views to communicate with one another with very little effort, often reinforcing said views.

The internet has also greatly increased the amount of generalities that are discussed on the internet, allowing people to talk about issues with a lot more depth and depth than they ever have before.

"I know this is basically a long ten- page essay, but if you read, I'd appreciate it. I need to get some things off my chest. okay, so, as a background, I'm gonna start in my childhood when I was in 4th and 5th grade. When I was 10 I tried to attempt suicide with a jump rope. At 9 and 10 I vividly remember being severely depressed, yet functioning. I would go to school, aftercare, and then come home and I'd hate it and spend most of the day either in my room, having my brother make fun of me, or distracting myself by talking to my mom. I remember being bullied and having bad anger issues I threatened my bullies on a daily basis, even pulling out scissors on one of them . I hated myself and in aftercare, I would stick to the designated ""Art Room""to distract and detach myself from other kids in the common room, even though I was obviously extroverted. I went to therapy after my suicide attempt. I don't remember much except for the fact that I had a toxic tendency to make sketchy online decisions, such as online dating and talking to adults and we mainly focused on that. So on, so forth, in conclusion, I apparently wasn't diagnosed with a single thing and I think that was such bullshit. The only reason I know this is because my mom used this fact to hold over my head when I asked for therapy at later years. Middle school was rough and I had a lot of self- deprecating thoughts, but I guess I eventually learned to live with it around seventh eighth grade and it turned into twisted humor of mine. I guess as a result the thoughts got toned down. High school, Freshman year was pretty good? I know there were good moments I can't just specifically remember what. I remember having friend troubles and crying a lot out of stress from that. Reminder I am functioning throughout all this. I still go to school and hang out with friends when I can. Sophomore year fucking sucked. I was barely functioning, I went to school and hung out with friends, but I would cry and freak out at least one class a day. I remember being in my own head so much, I would look at someone and just know that they hated the fucking life out of me. I guess this is when my passive suicidal thoughts came back. Maybe it was always there in the form of self- deprecation humor that I had in middle school that made whatever I was feeling bearable. I had one or two panic attacks a sophomore year and I remember being so irritable and getting into arguments with my friends over nothing. I actually fucking hated myself. I remember ranting to a friend and saying, ""I am the cause of all my problems, ""and I still agree with that to this day. The only difference is now that I have grown numb to the thoughts and the self- deprecation. I know I'm not like this every day. I have good days and regular days a lot of the time, in fact, at months at a time. The issue is I don't know if I have toxic or irregular behaviors anymore cause it's been normalized by my family. I do get out of bed and maintain a social life and decent grades by turning a lot of work late, cheating, I won't deny that I no longer have the same passion for learning I once did. It honestly all depends on the teacher I have if I try in that class or do the bare minimum . I do have the drive to maintain my GPA solely off the fact that I always panic about my future. I remember when I loved to do art and would draw every day, I aspired to be a character designer and now that is also lost in the abyss. As soon as I started high school I stopped and I hate myself for it. I try to force myself to draw, and I'm simply ""satisfied""with the result. No pleasure comes to me from drawing anymore other than the simple fact that I did it. I don't shower, brush my teeth, hygiene is not my forte. I also hate myself for that too because I want to have acne- free skin, I do love my curls and want them to constantly look good, I want to be as attractive as I know I can be. Im not ugly, I just don't put any work into myself. I always wear a hoodie, sweatpants, and sandals to school. So much to the point that some classmates freshman year thought I was genuinely poor. I wore Nike's once to school and they said ""I'm so proud you could buy something for yourself! ""I know I'm just ranting at this point, but let me get to the point now. Usually, I have good days, it's just that every couple months something tips me over the edge and I end up having full- on breakdowns from them. For Example, Picture day this year, junior year, I ended up literally going through something similar to psychosis. It was the scariest shit I've ever been through. Worse than a panic attack, and no one did anything to help me, I was in that meltdown for about 4- 5 hours. I remember feeling like I had no control over my own body and that ""nobody cares""just kept repeating in my head. I would laugh and cry at the same time, pretend to shoot people with a finger gun and just laugh. As if I realized some cruel joke was going on in the world and I was the only one who understood. I tried to draw to get out of my own head, all I ended up drawing was death and scribbles. A similar thing I've done since freshman year. This happens constantly, multiple times, every year. I somehow manage to sleep it off and wake up the next day and act as if nothing happened. Only joking about it crudely after the fact. I think I have something going on with me, I'm not sure what? I know it's not good to self diagnose but every time I have these meltdowns I get catatonic and suicidal. I always doubt myself, am I depressed, or am I faking it? Am I actually happy most of the time? Or is that a mask I've just been so good at making? I don't understand myself and it stresses me out. Sometimes, when I'm on a call with my friends, something will just set me off, I mute my mic and cry. Then I put it back on and pretend nothing happened","I have a history of suicidal self - harm thoughts , most of the time I 'm functioning and happy ? , but when I crash , I crash hard . Then wake up the next day as if nothing happened and I 'm happy ? , until another couple weeks or months before something happens again and I crash hard once more .

"Hello there, I guess I just want to get this off of my mind because it's really confusing. Honestly it's a vent but I need support. So I have been going to therapy but recently I embarrassed myself in a session and honestly I didn't feel supported by my therapist, but not about the thing that embarrassed me. It's just that I have been feeling very down in the dumps about trying to seek treatment, as the very first med I used a few weeks ago gave tons of side effects, and my parents and its failure really lowered my confidence about them because I essentially have to convince myself that the meds might work, and then work to convince them, so obviously tiring. And instead of my therapist comforting me and suggesting something that might help, she just told me about a study of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia benefitting just as well from psychotherapy as they did with meds, and that mental health problems aren't forever, and while that does sound like a way to make me feel better it just made me feel like if all I have to do is change the way I think, why am I even trying to treat this like health problem? Why call it even real if it's my fault for not changing the way I think? Why do I need to seek ""treatment""if it's not real? And so I'm hoping to quit therapy soon. But I also can't help but feel that that isn't true. It just doesn't make sense to me. To make matters worse, my therapist really doesn't want me to ask for extra accommodations at my job for the things I have problems with because she doesn't think that it would be helpful especially since ""I'm learning how to cope"". In that case, why don't I just keep masking and ignoring my issues like before, then? What's the point in going to therapy? It just frustrates me. I don't know. I don't want to keep going to therapy if it's just a fault in my thinking. I honestly don't want to attend any ""mental health appointments""if my mental health ""condition""isn't even real.

"Parents have hated me for years. Just had a panic attack about to attempt suicide again so I asked an ex for help because I trust him.

"I wish I could feel. I know I need to go downstairs, cry, and tell my mom how much I miss her and need her. How sorry I am for the pain Ive put her through these past few years. But I cant.

For example, when I had a negative feeling about something I had to talk to my boss about vacation time, something I needed to get signed that wasn't perfect , I would try and try and try to get my mind off it and fail , and it would take me a lot to get myself to do whatever it was. Now, even though I am still having some negative thoughts, I am able to talk myself out of them with ease and I am more productive because of that. I am also friendlier because I am able to stop myself from being consumed by irrational negative thoughts about what others think about me. Now, I know about euphoria and amphetamines, and I am worrying if this is because of this and not a normal effect of the meds. This has caused me to consider that anxiety really may not be a big problem as it appears the reaction is the problem. But mainly, I want to know is this something that others have experienced? And is the effect I am getting something that will last?","Meds are not necessarily getting rid of my anxiety , but causing me to not be so paralyzed by it one good effect among others . Is this something I can expect to continue ?","Adderall is making it easier to push away negative thoughts and motivate myself to do things I feel anxious about, but I am not sure if this is a normal effect of the meds or a side effect of euphoria and amphetamines.

"Hello Im posting in hopes that someone will have been in a similar situation to me and would be able to point me in the direction of a solution. So, ever since I was at an age where I could get a job I have absolutely hated it. Im 21 and have had 8 jobs and the only jobs I can semi function in are cleaning jobs because I dont have to speak to anyone and the shifts are never longer than 2.5 hours. Up until recently its not been too much of an issue because my student loan covers my rent and I only really need enough to pay for bills, car insurance and food. Now the issue is Im coming into my third and final year of uni and have started looking towards the future. I cant go back to my home as the room I was staying in is now occupied and I have a strained relationship with my family anyway. So Im looking to try and get a flat or a room in shared accommodation but I wont be earning enough with my current job cleaning to do that. So I need a therapist to help me get over this hatred I have for work. Its not even that I dont want to work because I do, I want to be an illustrator! But whenever I have shifts longer than a few hours I get frustrated, angry, depressed and Ive left way too many jobs mid shift to call 111 because Im suicidal. So does anyone know what sort of therapy would be best for me to seek out for this sort of thing and does anybody else have this reaction to working?",my bpd prevents me from working and I need a solution so I can afford to live and survive .

"Hi there, i don't typically use reddit but I can't think of a specific forum in which would be more suitable to post I'm 21m and live in New Zealand. At the beginning of the year I learnt more about ADHD and realised it was much more than just the symptoms of hyperactivity that I had associated with ADHD, after talking with online friends that have been diagnosed, I felt throughout my life I had experienced the same difficulties they had, and the more I looked back into my life, the more connections I made. I was referred to a psychologist from my counselor and i started undergoing an assessment that took over a month to complete interviews with Me, family and cognitive testing from which a diagnosis of inattentive ADHD as well as social phobia was made. The day after I got the report, i went to see my GP who proceeded to tell me that ""A adult diagnosis of ADHD is extremely controversial""and ""Don't put much weight into the diagnosis"", i asked him if he would prescribe me with medication for it and he said ""Adult ADHD is treated much differently to child ADHD, typically without the use of stimulants, we have to take it slowly, very slowly and possibly review after sessions of CBT""which clearly conflicts with the recommendations in my report. Since then, this has really troubled me, the psychologist warned me that it was controversial, and that I had the right to switch doctors, but im very scared it will seem as if i'm doing it to get drugs. I started this process in hopes of getting myself sorted and ready to move on to university but now i'm more lost than when I started, ADHD doesnt affect me massively at home or anything like my anxiety does but it hits hard at school and it's clearly evident in my school work","Recently diagnosed , my doctor does n't agree with psychologists findings and is n't very willing to pursue treatment Sorry it turned into a rant , i 'm frustrated and needed to type it into words ","I was diagnosed with ADHD, GP doesn't want to prescribe me meds and i'm scared it will seem as if i m doing it to get drugs. What should I do?",I was diagnosed with ADHD at the start of this year and my doctor didn't seem to put much importance into the diagnosis.

"Hi i am 21 from Pakistan still dependent on my parents surprising that is normal here I have felt like i have had adhd for a long time and have checked symptoms against DSM- 5 pretty sure i have inattention kind mix with some hyperactivity symptoms. I have watched many videos of people talking about what its like to have adhd and i fit the bill. I am forgetfull even with daily routine i cant count the times i have forgotten to take my backpack scool uni with me only to be reminded by someone about it. I can never focus on lectures in class. I have no recollection of deadlines only to be reminded by friends that the assignment is due in an hour and i had absolutely no idea. I am finding it progressively harder and harder to read books lectures even when i have my finals recently i had decided to pull an all nighter to study for a paper and even though i was up all night i studied nothing i was utterly disappointed with myself so much so that i finally decided to get help which is why i am here. That just some of my academic struggles, socially i can never remember anything that a friend told i used to that it was mostly because i didn't care but after seeing so my testimonials i feel that it is a more common occurrence. I have been made fun of by friends for being slow not in the moment. I struggle with which eye to look at while in a one to one conversation or if even to look at. I space out on conversations. On the topic of spacing out, i have my own car and i don't drive which is considered weird here because i have a couple of incidents but the one that stuck with me when i spaced out driving and i missed a pedestrian by an inch and since then i have avoided driving. I have social anxiety because of the things i have mentioned even though i have fair amount of friends but outside of those friends i avoid social interaction, i hate using social media i hate replying to text. Also i have issues with time management. I always struggle to finish test that my pairs find it very easy to finish. The worst example of this for me was one of my final examination a year ago this was the course in which i had the highest term marks in my class but i botched up the final i did my half my final in quarter of the time so i relaxed and let myself be drifted off and majority of it went incomplete. I have a lot of racing thoughts and i always tend to veer of course whether it be conversation or an essay one such example would be i turned a short story about an animal into a story in a post apocalyptic world with a mutant creature being last hope for humanity teacher loved the story but still gave me no marks for it . I feel like i should mention the cliche about teachers writing things like ""SHOW POTENTIAL BUT NEED TO WORK HARDER""and variations of it. I had a couple of more points to make but i forgot probably best to keep it short. So i know its a big no no here to ask people for diagnoses and stuff but if you guys would just make an exception here and let me know if you guys can relate and are these the symptoms because here's the thing mental illnesses are a thing here you can only be a normal person a healthy functioning brain anyone that is not is consider retarded. No one here is aware of ADHD or the spectrum or anything of that sort you just need to fit into this society and conform to its rules as if everyone is the same. So i need to be sure about this before i tell my parents about these problems and even if i do manage to do that i am afraid if the psychiatrist doesn't think i have adhd and i just make an entire fool of myself",I will break this down into points - I think i have adhd - Ca nt focus - bad at time management - have taken procrastination to a new level - forgetful - Racing thoughts - Insomniac - Need to be sure - How do i tell my parent who have no idea what ADHD is and tell them its not just me being lazy ps if you just want to say that this post is against the rules please just give me advise on how to talk to my parents about something they never heard of . How do i explain ADHD to them without making them think that it 's just an excuse or that university stress is too much for me,i think i have adhd but i can't tell my parents about it because i don't want to make them think i am retarded and i am afraid i will make an entire fool of myself,I think i have adhd but i am afraid to tell my parents because i don't want them to think i am faking it or making an entire fool out of myself.,I have symptoms of adhd i fit the bill pretty sure i have it but i need to be sure before i tell my parents about these problems and even if i do manage to do that i am afraid if the psychiatrist doesn't think i have adhd and i just make an entire fool of myself. I have a lot of racing thoughts and i ca nt focus on lectures lectures even when i have my textbooks with me.

I'll be getting a roommate at the end of summer but until that I'm on my own. Spring is the worst time for my depression. I find that animals help. They give me a reason for getting out of bed, getting outside, and a reason to stick around. I had a big dog growing up and she was my best friend.

"Hi, i'm 20 years old and been depressed since around 11. i'm writing to r depression for support, but not in the way of advice, not too much anyway. I've been socially odd for these years, always in a circle of cool people but never able to deliver, always the first to not be invited to something. I went to community college, with help of psychologist made it to a university. Have great support in the form of my dad and psych, but I could only press on, never deal with the build up of my depression. I finally gave up 2 semesters ago, and skipped every class mentally and or physically, not in favor of partying, but in favor of doing nothing with life. Found my first girlfriend. She talked to me! Love at first chit chat, i awkwardly texted her here and there, and eventually drunk talked to her again at a party, we hung out sober, we dated for a year and a couple of months. It was a very poisonous relationship though, we were both depressed, her situation possibly worse than mine, but i believe i am not as strong as she is, so were almost equal. I digress, these are not the things I need help with, but ill get to that in a sec. more like 5 minutes apparently So we dated at the uni, both depressed, her hurting herself sometimes, i've had to pull a knife from her hand. A few times. Her dream was to go to foreign country , we studied abroad the next semester. I am a person who values sedentary- ness, yet it was literally so dire that i agreed to study abroad and pursue her dream in order to get us away from our lives at our university. Looking back, it was amazing, but we had already done a lot damage to each other, and i needed to end the relationship when we got back if she could live alone without hurting herself. success, shes joining a sorority, ive lost her but now i want to ruin all ive built and be with her, risking her life possibly to be together, its that volatile, our relationship . Anyway, i took a semester off because i was so done with everything , im back at the drawing board and wanting to deal with my problems. I'm going to go back to boxing, working, reading help books, staying strong and not professing my love to her, in hopes we can both be repaired when we meet again, next semester, etc etc. I'm anxious literally all day of everyday, my heart pounds as i lay to sleep, i cry for people i dont know, for myself, for my family who is living comfortably, for the people id leave behind if i had whatever it takes to harm myself, which i don't, i cry for all the possibilities the world has. Now i think you know enough, so here's my problem. I'm trying everything i can starting tomorrow to work on this, as i said goin back to my psych now that i'm home. There's one thing i can't tell him however, not the drugs, horrible relationship, sex, bad thoughts, crazy thoughts, but actually the cause of my back problems. I feel that since i cant quite tell him this he kind of has a dad thing goin on when i go there, might need a new psych but weve unraveled a lot about the roots of some of my issues, and i dont want to search for someone as good Sorry if your confused, try to keep going. So here it is, with a wee backstory. In highschool, probably around 11th grade after my first and only other sexual partner, a girl id loved since 7th grade who started my depression after dating my bestfriend and hookin up first time on my damn birthday lol, banged some other dude years later, when i had finally lost my virginity to her. I was really confused, and already a horny bastard who masturbated everyday. Eventually i discovered, god this is hard even anonymously, that i can give myself a blowjob. I got sort of addicted to this, even though it didn't really feel good. I now have horrible back and neck problems, there were times i pulled my back doing it and any person but me would have never done it again, and i haven't in years, but this is the first time telling anyone but myself again. I'm not sure if i need anything more from you than to let it out, but feel free to try and help","Too damn depressed and need to do something drastic , so i m finally revealing my secret of self blow jobs in order to get another step to recovering helping my depression out of the way , in pursuit of fixing myself in order to reenter my relationship with the msot loving , yet horrible girl i ve ever met . I 'm sorry for run on sentences , but yea , sorry . ","i'm depressed, i ca nt tell my psych i've been depressed for a long time, i'm going to go back to him tomorrow to try to work on my problems, but i do nt want to ruin the relationship i ve worked so hard to repair, i want to be with the girl i love but i m scared i 'll ruin everything if i tell him.","I've been depressed since 11, i'm 20 now, i want to be with my ex again but i ca nt tell her about my depression because i do nt want to ruin all the progress i ve made.

"My first post This might be a little long. I am a 19 year old female and was only diagnosed with ADHD about three months ago and I am going into third year in university. I graduated high school with an average of 93 . I always worked hard and studied hard, I wasn't one of those people who bragged that they didn't have to study to get good marks. When I hit university my marks were ridiculously awful, my self awareness of how I thought I was doing was completely skewed. And my relationships either with boyfriend s , friends or parents were getting strained. During my first and second year I was thought to have been depressed or extremely anxious and kind of a mystery since I was not responding positively to any types of medication for depression. LONG STORY SHORT. I have the ADHD. Lately I have been feeling so much better knowing that during the past couple years I have not been operating at full capacity. My marks aren't because I'm lazy or stupid. It's because I couldn't even handle what was happening. Now I am getting my shit together academically and I have never felt better, but now it seems like I am leading myself to my own demise by being insanely neurotic. I constantly am feeling like everyone hates me, that I am not worthwhile, or that anyone I interact with just automatically does not like me whether it is with friends, acquaintances, prof, ANYONE . This post is more about me wondering if anyone with ADHD or recently diagnosed with ADHD has experienced these feelings. Am I the only one that can never turn off their mind on this subject? If not, I guess I am doomed. If so, any advice, experiences or tips on how to improve on this aspect would be greatly appreciated. I am fairly new too all of this and I am completely prepared to do the work to get better as these things never happen overnight",I ca n't stop thinking that everyone hates me .

"So basically my 29M girlfriend 30F just broke up with me after 2 years of mutual support and only good and affectionate moments. I myself struggle with anxiety and some level of depression hence this post. She told me very clearly from the start that she had been diagnosed with depression, she was also very clear when she said she didn't believe in treatment and would not try to do it. I accepted her decision it was not for me to judge as we both had come from former bad experiences and that brought us together even more. The relationship sarted slowly but became something very special, allowing us to have some of the best moments in our lives. We both shared moments and feelings and helped each other overcome our fears a lot. Then, slowly, in the last 6 months she started feeling her depression taking a toll on her and even though I asked her if it was anything related to something I had said or done she always said no, it was her, not the relationship. We then went on and had more great moments together but the depression became stronger and stronger. Now this is when all goes down I myself started having issues with my family and work to the point of being physically ill by anxiety. Also verbalized that i wanted to make radical changes in my life but never said I didn't want her in because I did want her to be part of my life, so we had some miscommunication here . At the same time, we had booked some holidays for one week and that happened exactly when I was figuring out what was going on with me now I know it was belly ache and intestinal pain due to stress and anxiety . I struggled through the week and tried to be the best I could amidst my intense pain. I could see she was scared and lost in how to react and it drained even more. She even told me that after. We tried to talk it out and I tried to explain what had happened, and that all relationships go through bad moments, but she isolated herself and things took a turn for the worse. Fast- forward to last week, she told me she couldn't go on, that she had no strength to fight and didn't want to drag me down with her, and was in no condition of being in a relationship, despite liking me and saying that I had been the only person to treat her well and make her feel so special I do feel the same about her and am so grateful for all she did for me . I told her I'd always be there for her and I was willing to help and be on her side, but she told me it would be unfair to ask me for that and that the decision had already been made. She then thanked me for everything, as did I. I just can't bring myself to cope with it and understand why and how something so special could be ended just like that, we fell at the first hurdle and did not even tried to fight back. I'm lost, hurt, anxious and scared and and my depression is coming back and I don't know how to deal with all of this in my head. Thank you so much in advance for reading all of this","girlfriend broke up with me due to depression , despite all the good moments that made her feel loved in the relationship and saying she liked me . Said she did n't feel the strength to fight and needed to isolate herself and that it was n't fair for me to wait nor being hold off until she eventually felt better again .

"I've never been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder and my particular circumstances don't match up with a lot of people's here i.e no panic attacks, raised heart rate, etc. . That being said, I have had terrible anxiety of a sort for the past four or five months and it is certainly affecting my daily life. In my case, I simply cannot stop thinking about losing my job. I am a graduate student and had a dream internship over the summer. In mid- june I made a off- color joke while out with some co- workers. It was debatably racist and definitely inappropriate in this setting. I meant absolutely no offense fiance is a member of race implicated and this dumb joke just sprang to mind and others were making similar jokes. Anyway, immediately after the words left my lips I started freaking out and thinking that I wouldn't get an offer to return. I was also just really embarrassed as I don't harbor any prejudices and this was really uncharacteristic. This is my dream job and in the perfect location near my fiance who has been long distance for far too long. I freaked out about this and became a full blown insomniac, sleeping 2- 3 hours a night. Finally, with about a week left in the internship I confided in a younger person at the company that this was keeping me up. He assured me no one remembered and that I was crazy to be so worried. I ended up getting an offer to return but am now worried that my worry will be office gossip and that word of the joke might get to someone who is offended who would go to HR etc. in the year before I go back to start work for real I have one more year of classes .

"Hey Everyone, I'm Jonathan, a 20 year old German guy, and this is my story! I've always been a kind of shy person for all my life! I remember being scared of ordering icecream when I was a child. On the first day at my first 4 schools I went to 6 I cried because I was scared. All that got even worse when I was bullied in 5th- 6th grade. During that time I was ashamed as soon as anyone glanced at me, I felt so judged that I wished the ground would open and swallow me up. At my new school for 7th- 8th grade I was integrated with the boys of my class, but I could never speak my mind if I was talking to more than 1 person, I was trying so hard to fit in that I someone else would have an opinion, and agree with that. I could never speak to girls, and I vividly remember one time when I was at the movies with a friend, and we ran into a girl from our class there, and I was so anxious when I hugged her, it felt like I had a pulse of 300. And whenever I would be talking to a girl I would just blank, freeze and start sweating. In 9th grade at yet another school I was in a class of 2- 3 girls and 15- 16 boys. The boys where extremely competitive, and constantly dissing each other just for fun. I couldn't really get used to that, and stayed at home feeling sick a lot that year. In 10th grade I changed to another class in that same school. I made some good friends I was able to speak my mind to, and started to become more confident with my opinion. I also did quite some public speaking that year I became the students representative and had to give speeches in front of the whole school 200- 300 people , and also had to moderate a school festival on stage also a few hundred people . We also had to do a presentation of our final paper in front of a few hundred people. After that I didn't wanna continue school right away, and stayed at home for about a year. I became pretty lonely during that time, and had some mild phases of depression. Then I got a job at a local gas station, and with that I got way more used to making small- talk with people. I mostly stuck to the necessary sentences tho, and very rarely really had a conversation with people compared to my colleagues that had a conversation with almost half the people . In December 2016, after a year at the gas station, I decided to quit my job and fulfill my dream to go to Australia for a year of work and travel. Before that I went to Spain where I visited my uncle. Since he lives on a mountain I didn't really get to go out that much, and the few times I did go out, I was pretty anxious, when I decided to eat something I sometimes wandered around for 30- 60 minutes because I was to scared to go into a restaurant, I think the language barrier had something to do with that, but fears like that were something I hadn't experienced for a while. Right now I'm in a Hostel in Australia, and on my afirst few days I started talking to 2 German girls, and we went out a few times. That would've been unthinkable even just a year or two ago, so I""m very happy I was able to do that! They had to leave and go back to Germany after a few days tho 1, 5 weeks ago and after that I became more and more anxious. I bought a laptop to edit my photos on when they left, and the first few days I only used it for that, but then I started watching YouTube on there, and spending a lot of time behind the screen. The last few days have been like this I want to talk to people, and there are lots of people around, I even have ideas how I could initiate a conversation, but I can't get myself to do it. I feel like it would be weird, or that I would bother them, because they're doing their own thing or they're in their own conversation already. So I just sit there between all these people that are having conversations and are socializing, and just can't get myself to join them. This has been going on for the last few days. I mean it's good that I at least had to go shopping a few times so I got out of the hostel, and at least talked to the cashiers. I also had a few conversations with the people in my room, I think that was good for not getting too much into a downward- spiral, but the conversations were never longer than a few minutes, and there wasn't anyone I could really spend time with. So right now I feel a little stuck I wanna socialize, and I think I've gotten kind of decent with that, but I just can't for the heck of it initiate a conversation when it's not served on a gold platter. And it has to be a really shiny and well polished gold platter. Like new people moving into my room, or meeting someone I've seen in the Hostel outside the Hostel","I 've come pretty far , from being ashamed of people just looking at me , to being on the other side of the planet on my own , and meeting new people , but I 'm still not quite where I wanna be .

I don't know what to do.","I've always been a shy person for all my life, I'm 20 now, and I want to talk to people, but I can't get myself to do it. I feel like it would be weird, or that I would bother them, and that it would make them uncomfortable. I don't know what to do.","I've been a shy person for all my life, bullied in elementary school, became more introverted in middle school and high school, and had a lot of social anxiety.

I feel like it would be weird to join a group of friends that are all doing their own thing, and I 'd be bothering them.

" serious TRIGGER WARNING MENTION OF SUICIDE This happened a few minutes ago and I don't know what to do. I had some family issues going on, but they were quite trivial they seemed the end of the world at the time but really weren't .

So I added at the end that i understand if she just ignores this, cause I'd rather have that than a condescending ""whining won't do anything""message in response. Anyways, she gets online, and responds with ""don't know what you want me to do, u have to stop relying on people to help you""I explained I wasn't expecting any help, it was more of a ""needing a friend to justbe a friend""kind of thing. I didn't think much of it. Few minutes later, she responds. She seems very angry but the last thing I want is an argument, so I just attempt to lighten the mood. She sends me a paragraph about how I can't possibly expect her to always help me or whatever. I think this is unusually rude of her, bt I decide not to start an argument, since that would be petty, and my head already hurt. After the paragraph, she concludes with ""oh by the way my uncle committed suicide today. Have a good day""I don't think I'll be able to talk to her for a while. I told her how I didn't know about the situation and that I'm here for her since I do believe in helping people just by being a friend didn't say it condescendingly of course and she hasn't responded.

"Hi, I don't really have a support system. I have friends and family, but I am not close to any of them, I don't talk about depression with them, and none of them know that I'm currently engaging in self- harm, with the exception of my SO. The other night I had an anxiety attack and a fight with my SO. I had some strong urges to self- harm afterwards and I begged my SO for forgiveness and help. He told me no way and that we are through because he ""can't handle this shit anymore.""I don't really blame him for that, but the abandonment on top of it was too much and I self- harmed. He ended up calling 911 and I was taken to the ER in an ambulance my SO did not come along . This wasn't the first time, a couple months ago I drove myself to the ER due to a bad self- inflicted wound. Both times I had the doctor and social worker asking me about my ""support system""who drove you here? Who's with you here now? Who can you talk to when you're feeling like this? Uh, well, there's no one with me and no one I can talk to about this. It's obvious that at this point in my life, when things are the lowest for me, the only people who are there for me are strangers who are paid to take care of me. And even they resent a ""drama queen""like myself who can't get her shit together. Why not confide in a friend? because I like having friends even if we're very casual friends and I don't see them that often. When I was a teenager I let in all hang out depression wise. I was under the impression that you have to let feelings out, you have to talk about things and you have to be true to yourself. And nobody wanted to be around me. I have a vivid memory of a teen boy going off on me ""Oh my god, you are the MOST negative person I have ever met. you are so negative.""I also had kinder friends quietly leave me when I got too down. they said ""Maybe you just need to be alone for awhile and figure things out.""I really, really don't want to be alone. So I've changed the way I interact with people. I try very hard to be positive, I do not talk about how I'm feeling, I hide self- injury at all costs. I think this strategy does make me feel better because I get to keep friends and faking it at least inspires people to return genuine positive energy to me. But it's also exhausting when I'm depressed. I'm not very social because I'm just not up for the constant charade. I'm a casual friend myself. I don't have much to offer friendship wise, so if I burden someone by asking for a ride to the hospital or explain that I feel like killing myself there's really not much of an incentive for them to deal with my ""baggage.""One thing that helps I'll call a friend when I'm feeling down and just chat with them about what's going on in their life. People don't mind talking about themselves in general and it distracts me from my life and makes me feel less isolated","I 'm struggling a lot with self - harm and depression .

I 'm not very close to any of my friends and b. in the past , talking about these things was too negative and I lost friends . How important is having friends to confide in for recovery ? Is there any way I can broach the subject without risking a friendship too much ?","I don't have a support system, I've changed the way I interact with people and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to confide in a friend when I feel like I need to.","I don't have a support system, I'm not close to any of my friends or family, and I've changed the way I interact with people to try to be positive, but it doesn't work.

"So I'm 16 years old. I've been depressed since I was about 14. Lately it's been nothing but missed school days, root beer floats and hours of netflix.

""Maybe you could find a metaphorical mountain to inhabit at times to focus on that part and take on board other's reactions more gradually, as you feel able to. iirc, education about the diagnosis is the first step to understanding, for yourself.

"People have depressed episodes. People also can feel emotionally drained. Others are really good at empathising with people. The difference between those that i stated and someone who is clinically depressed is that the clinically depressed experience these things for much longer periods. Months and maybe a whole year.

Those who go through depressive episodes, emotionally drained, or are good at empathising with people shouldnt be disregarded however. Everyone's feelings are absolutely valid. These cases would usually last a couple hours, a day, a weekend, maybe a week. After such, they would function as normal beings.

"For the last couple of years, I've been falling in and out of a state of dysfunction or depression. Staying isolated inside my apartment for days if not weeks , eating too rarely and completely messing up any sort of natural sleeping schedule. I like to view myself as mentally strong and I seem to get by fairly well in the world that exists outside of my head. I have great friends, and am constantly making new ones. I have a partner which loves me dearly, but happens to live countries away which restricts our meetings to every second or third month . My family is great but currently somewhat torn apart after a rough divorce between my parents. At university I get decent grades even though my effort is less than noteworthy. I already at a young age have resume I'm confident of, and have exciting plans for the future. I'm not insecure about my appearance either, and keep my body in fit shape. Woah, that's a lot of ""I"", seems my ego came out . In conversation with my friends, I'm seldom afraid to open up, and I often share my worries over my depression, which honestly is excruciating at points. However a problem that then occurs is that it's always hard for them and sometimes myself included to imagine that I truly am suffering. I've tried to explain my depression as rooted in a personal incident that happened two years back, but as it could have been true at one point - I have to admit that I at least believe I am no longer bothered by that incident, and that I am perhaps just holding on to it only as a justification of my sadness. I think, or well.. I am terrified of not being able to justify my state, my weakness, and misuse of my current life. I think that comes from having been open with most of my friends, which in turn have let me to be blessed not in a religious way with so much trust and intimate conversations, in which I get to listen to real, tangible hardships. I have a great interest in philosophy and the kindness of human beings, and suppose it's one of my life's ambitions to find a way of being a great friend or human in general to all those I come by during my few years. It's a purely egotistical wish, as I find my happiness in creating happiness for others. In my view of life, everyone is driven by their own ego, so I'm not ashamed of that, my problem is just that I'm missing out on so much of that happiness by this crippling self- isolation. I have at no point been suicidal, and I think life will always have potential to be great for those willing to look for the good in it. At this point I'm just not able to pull myself out of a torment I can't defend or explain the roots of. I'm lost to the point where I don't know what I'm asking of you, but if you took the time to read my post I'm grateful. Even more so if you'd care to post a comment, a question, or an advice, as I have come to realise I can't get out of this on my own","I 've lived my last two years in and out of a depression which I can no longer give any reason for , and yet I can not escape it .

Funny how you can come to miss the mundane .","I've been depressed for a few years, and I'm not sure how to pull myself out of it.

"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster. Not really sure where to begin I recently quit drinking and smoking, 78 days clean. I used to drink and smoke to help numb the depression and shoosh the anxiety that came from my sub- par upbringing. I'm 30 years old, and have a one year old son, I live on my gf's mother of my child dad's property. I've always been quite the under achiever, I'm intelligent and well spoken, but usually had issues at school, mostly behavioural problems. I started smoking pot at about twelve when my step mother was diagnosed with lung cancer, I was usually out roaming the streets with my friends until about 11pm at night. By 13 my step mother kicked the bucket, and my father died of an anuerysm by the time I was 15. At that point I had to go live with my mother and my stepdad, who I had a lot of issues with growing up my mother that is she was quite neglectful emotionally as she ""was always working"". I never really felt like I fit in at my mothers with the rest of my younger half siblings, im the third eldest out of seven. Fast forward 15 years and I'm at the point I am now, that 15 years was full of drug abuse, abusive relationships, suspended sentences, fake friends, arguements with my family, counseling, drug detoxes, etc. Most of that stuff is behind me now but I just feel empty inside, the young lady I ended up having a child with turned out to not be the person I thought she was. Now I just feel like I'm waiting to die, due to the fact suicide really isn't an option for me, as I'm way to much of a coward to actually go through with it and don't want to out my son through not having a father because it sucks","ex drug abuser w mental health issues stuck in a shitty relationship with the mother of child , not sure how to get escape , do n't really want to kill myself either just waiting to die .","I'm 30 years old, have a one year old son, used to drink and smoke to numb the depression and anxiety that came from my sub - par upbringing, now I'm waiting to die due to the fact suicide isn't an option.","I'm 30 years old, have a son 1 year old and have a history of drug abuse and substance abuse.

"I don't believe in any sort of afterlife or meaning of existence, and have considered myself a nihilist for the longest time now. In a way, I find this philosophy to be very comforting We're all fucked. No matter who you are, ultimately you'll end up in the same place as everyone else. Nonexistence seems like Nirvana to me. I wish I could wake up every morning and just tell myself this over and over again, so I could truly just not give a damn and live my life to the fullest but quite frankly, I'm scared shitless. Right now, the only thing that truthfully gets me out of bed each morning is work and to eat most of the time I never even have an appetite otherwise, I'd stay in bed for the entire day. I've never been diagnosed with anything before, and have never spoken to a therapist although, I am intrested, yet literally cannot bring myself to have that talk with my folks .

"edit just got back from the doctor. relatively relieved to find out most of the things i'm feeling are a result of my cold sinus infection. I must've never had a sinus infection before, cause this is fairly new to me as I said. thanks for your help guys! I've never experienced it quite like this, but it just started a few days ago. Some backstory I had fairly severe anxiety in 2011 started around January brought on from work- related stress. It lasted and has continued to persist all the time, but I managed to find a coping mechanism exercise to help feel better and make progress. Up until January 1st this year, I felt like my anxiety was 99 managed and under control no panic, no random physical symptoms, etc . Fast forward to December 31st. I'm doing fairly well and feel relatively normal. I hosted a NYE party in my apartment with a few of my roommates and it was awesome. I had a LOT to drink I've had plenty of alcohol in the past, only a few times a month, and maybe seriously drunk only a few times throughout the year . Probably more than I've ever had, actually. I woke up January 1st and felt terrible, but I figured it was just a hangover. But later that night it started, I felt a little anxious because the hangover never went away like it always had in the past . I thought maybe I was sick, or still recovering from a cold I had in December, but it has been almost five days now and I feel like I can't do much physically. In fact, even my usual coping method of exercising just flat- out makes me feel exhausted all day. My smptoms are different, too eating too much makes me feel way more bloated than it should, pressure in my head, can't really concentrate, and my short- term memory feels off. So here's the deal I don't know if my anxiety is resurfacing, or I'm experiencing something else. I mean, yes, I'm slightly anxious because of how I feel, but I feel the physical stuff is superseding the anxiety this time. I don't feel ""worried""like I had when I had anxiety before, I just hang out and do normal stuff, but I feel physically ill this time. Maybe the alcohol had something to do with it? I plan to see a doctor tomorrow or Tuesday, but until then, I can't do much no health insurance, using university clinic . Also worth mentioning, the last year and a half I have been basically working full time and or been in school. I've been able to cope my anxiety well enough to be as productive, if not more, than before it started in 2011. Dunno if that information helps. Thanks r anxiety if you can help. If you know of any solutions aside from the ER, that would be really helpful","had a crazy NYE party , woke up and thought I had a hangover , ended up feeling more like anxiety and it 's been days . not sure what 's happening . my usual coping method of exercise does n't help , and actually makes me feel worse .","I've had anxiety for a year and a half now, but it's suddenly started a few days ago and I don't know if it is anxiety, or something else.

"She lives in another city, so we chat mainly via WhatsApp. She has been going through a very painful divorce, which is making her anxiety and panic issues even worse.

"Hey your symptoms describe me perfectly. I basically strive for perfection and when I don't achieve it I go into a depression and give it up until I start to get some motivation to do it again and then fail and go back into that cycle. Here's how my psychologist explained the cycle to me Perfectionistic tendencies - You expect things to live up to this huge standard and when things don't go the way you expect them to you go into the next stage. Depression Give Up You decide that its no longer worth it, you get angry or upset and then decide that why bother with this? Its never going to work out. It becomes a sort of learned helplessness. Guilt Motivation You start to feel like it was the wrong thing to do to give up. So many people were expecting this out of you and expecting that so you feel guilty. You decide okay I'll give it a try and try to change things. But when you try to change things, you expect everything to go according to plan. This entire cycle is what you described as the maladaptive perfectionism. In terms of advice for this? I'm still working on it with my psychologist but she pretty much told me that I just need to learn to accept certain people and things for the way they are especially if I can't change them.

"I don't have this 100 figured out but for me one way to tell that it's the ADHD and not laziness is if I genuinely want to do something but am physically or mentally unable to and don't know why I can't do it or how to make myself do it and the inability to do the thing is causing me distress. To me, laziness is just ""I can't be bothered I don't care enough to do the thing"", while executive dysfunction is a situation where there was some kind of effort even just the mental effort of trying to force myself to do stuff but it felt like something was blocking me from doing the thing. If I'm not upset about not having done something, I probably didn't do it just because I didn't want to.

"Started on 18mg concerta in Feb. Almost no difference.. Two weeks later went to 36mg. Strange attitude changes as well as a loss of time. I experienced a fair amount of irritability as well as a distorted perception of time, however I was aware of these side effects and could excuse myself when it was too much. Hated the side effects I was having, plus the benefit was negligible so after a month we switched to adderall XR 20mg. Immediately better, HOWEVER, I was still having issues constantly with being irritable, and while it helped my focus I would finish a day with the same ADD ""million things started, nothing completed"". It took me a while to step back and say ""Uhh oh.. This is just making me incredibly motivated and optimistic.. But it's not beneficial"".

"Well it's actually much more complicated neurologically speaking. Antidepressants may help calm and relieve stress in a sense but ADHD medicine is actually a stimulant and for that reason some of them can be prescribed to treat narcolepsy. ADHD drugs basically work by making you more awake, aware and focused and do this by increasing the release of certain neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine to name the two big ones while simultaneously preventing their reuptake. This is why it increases your metabolism, and can have effects on the heart norepinephrine is important in the bodies sympathetic regulatory system . This is also why ADHD drugs can sometimes cause anxiety. Many antidepressant drugs work inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine as well, but do so in a slight different manor. However for depression, more drugs now work by affecting the seratonin reuptake. Ecstasy works in a similar fashion by increasing seratonin and dopamine levels in he brain. This is why treating depression and ADHD can get complicated as you attempt to balance levels of all these important neurotransmitters",ADHD drugs are stimulants that make people more alert and focused .

"Hello everyone. I was hoping to get some advice on how to manage my anxiety over this situation. I have suffered through several episodes of anxiety in my life as well as 2 major bouts with different variations of OCD. I have only recently been studying up on mental health and reached out to a therapist about 2 years ago about my most recent case of OCD that dealt with uncertainty about my identity. I have been single for about 9 years now and came from a bit of a toxic relationship. I made mistakes and hurt my partner but she also hurt me emotionally in ways. I have moved on from it which took a bit of time. I needed roughly about 6 years of healing to move on. I have been trying to get back into the dating game and dated a girl that i liked for a short while but it didnt end up going anywhere as i found that she was just being nice and wasnt really interested. Now, I started getting close with this new girl and started to develop a friendship with her. I am extremely attracted to her physically and would like to start a relationship with her should she want the same. Were hitting it off pretty nicely recently but for about a couple of weeks now I have started to feel some anxiety over the relationship. Analyzing my thoughts i have found that im afraid of several stuff. Things might not work out, I might not really like her as much as i initially thought, I might not have a relationship with her beyond friendship. I think out of all these Im most afraid that i might not really like her as much as i initially thought but im not too sure about this. Ive read that much of this might be rooted in the fact that we might not know each other yet well enough. Ive read that i just need to get to know her more and enjoy the friendship as it develops. However when i think about what I dont like about her, I cant think of any reasons.

"So I found out today that the girl I'd liked and wanted to be with for a year and a half started to spread rumors about me at school after I confessed my feelings to her. So far, the ones I've encountered were about me sexually harassing her and putting my hand up her shirt, unbuttoning her shirt, taking her bra off, etc. This was all said to have happened during a class we had together, and she said that she didn't say yes to this which means that it is a no. The other rumor, and I'm sure there are more, is that I was threatening to kill her boyfriend and hurt her or myself if she didn't be with me. It's all complete bullshit and she has no proof, so it's her word against mine, but the police got involved from some concerned peers of her telling the resident cop and principle. I bare no grudge against them as they are just doing their part to help their friend, but since it is her word against mine and people always believe the female, I have the possibility of being registered as a sexual offender because of the sexual harassment lies, and I can have charges of terrorist threats be brought against me for the other lies I stated above. I apologize if this is incoherent, as I only found out this morning, and upon finding out that these could happen, I left school I am a senior, and my school doesn't care and went to sleep from 8 30, the time I arrived home, to 2 30. I am not seeking advice on this matter, the resident cop at the school said he believes me and won't file charges unless either her parents or her boyfriends decide that they want to. He said I am very well- spoken and articulate, and obviously too intelligent to say those things, but they have to investigate everything that they hear about this, which I do understand. He is just doing his job. He also said he knows the father of her boyfriend and said that he probably won't file charges, for a reason I can't remember, and that her parents probably won't file sexual harassment either, so I will probably be more than likely fine, but just the possibility of my entire life being ruined has infuriated me and subsequently caused my depression to go even lower than I thought possible. Also, the fact that the girl I liked and thought I knew did this has affected my depression as well As I said, I don't need advice, it will probably be just fine. The sole reason for this post was to share and say that I don't think I'm going to trust really any females after this, because even though this is the worst, it certainly isn't the first thing. I've had girls cheat on me, only be with me to make their ex jealous, all kinds of shit. I just don't even know what the fuck to do anymore.

"My depression has worsened. Im ashamed to admit that the reason is a guy. 3 weeks ago I gave a classmate my number on the last day of class in an attempt to get to know him better. We were taking a fun GE together and had short, but pleasant conversations during class periods. He was the only guy I was ever attracted to in my 3 years at university. Yes, I might have put him on a pedestal. Yes, Im aware I never even really knew him. Its hard to keep my emotions in check regardless of how much I try to rationalize with myself, though. Not only do I feel bad about him not contacting me, but I also feel bad about not asking him all those questions I wanted to ask the one time we ran into each other at the library. I had an exam in a half hour so I couldnt concentrate on our conversation. He was literally sitting right next to me, completely available and willing to have a conversation with me. Sometimes you really do get only one chance at things something I didnt realize at the time and I blew that one chance I had and now there is no second chance. It is VERY likely I may never see him again. I never even asked what classes he was taking next quarter so I have no way of knowing when hell be on campus. Hes all I ever think about. I wake up crying because of dreams Ive had of him. When will this end? Will I ever be able to heal? I thought I would be able to shrug it off within a week, but its been almost 3 weeks and I dont feel an ounce better. In fact, I feel worse. Way worse. The high that came from doing something as gutsy as giving a guy my number has long worn off. Now all thats left are my regrets and mistakes laid out in front of me. The worst part is I think I really did have a chance with this guy if we just had more time together. Im pretty, he laughed at my jokes, and people told me that we would have looked good together. I just feel bad that I didnt play the fucking game right or something. Also I feel bad that I didnt get to give him enough context or have one really personal, meaningful conversation with him. Were both graduating in 6 months. I feel like from a social perspective, Ive wasted my college years. I never had a fling or a boyfriend and never got invited to any parties.

"I'm 38. I was never diagnosed with SA but always hated avoided social interactions, was always the weird person in the room, had virtually no real- life friends, and was never comfortable talking about actual feelings opinions. I didn't have a real panic attack until 27 when I had a horrific job and have only had a couple of them. My mom paid for me to go to a therapist at 24 and it was super uncomfortable and I only went once and cancelled. When I realized I was mired in depression and doing nothing with my life but working and waiting to die, I went to see a therapist at 35. The first one was useless and I quit after 10 sessions. Six months later I realized I was in the same situation and did a lot more research into another. Very quickly I uncovered the programming behind my SA and it was 90 cured, over a year of talk therapy I got really comfortable accepting myself, being able to communicate openly and honestly, and I realized accepted how traumatized I was by things that I thought previously were normal. It really did fix a lot of my issues, I do a ton for myself that I never would have before, I obviously had a lot more self- esteem and interpersonal issues than just SA. At this point I'm happy talking to people, I can strike up a conversation, I don't avoid asking the clerk in the grocery store where something is, etc. Recently I've also started seeing a therapist who does EMDR and found it helped a lot to get me over the issues trauma I was revolving around and wasn't really aware was still sabotaging me.

"I dream about self harm sometimes, and I just woke up from one of those dreams. Usually I dream about cutting, but this time I dreamed that I was binging on soft foods marshmallows, jello, and gummy candy so that I could purge it in.

"This is a throwaway account. I need to unload or tell someone. I hope someone out there will read. Lately my life has been complete shit and just sad, completely out of my doing. Heres some context 1 My gf I met online two years ago is a grumpy asshole, and she got pregnant after I visited her. Im 90 sure shes mine but the doubt comes from the fact that her ex visited her after I did, but my gf insists Im the father. I was going to break up with her until I found out she was pregnant. We constantly argue and she has the biggest temper out of anyone Ive known. But its fun when were both good with each other and I can really be myself around her, which is rare for me. But now she gained a whole bunch of weight where shes practically obese shallow I know and I have little interest in her apart from my cute baby girl, who I do love and gives me hope. After the pregnancy everything is different, and Im not there to be with them. My gf never talks about future plans with me and does what she thinks is best for the baby which I appreciate, but didnt list me as her father says its for insurance reasons and shes in another country btw and leaves me out of a lot of decisions. I dont think its right or fair but I cant do anything. I think its bullshit and shes selfish. I planned to visit the country for two months for the birth of my daughter, was going to get a paternity test etc etc but long story short I was threatened to be put in jail by my gfs mother and it only ended up being a week and a half. Her family doesnt know Im the father btw. I only got to see my newborn daughter for a few minutes and I sometimes get doubt if shes mine. I guess time will tell? I get pictures and videos and FaceTime with her a lot. Since then Ive been a complete mess. Ive fooled around with other girls, paid for sex, gained weight, thought about taking drugs etc. Ive argued with my gf like crazy and I feel like a screw up. I sometimes feel like I should just leave them because I cant even take care of myself. Im just so tired of everything and just wanna be with my daughter. Am I being selfish? I decided that if I find out the baby isnt mine then Im going to kill myself. Otherwise, Im going to save up 100- 200k for my daughter and then kill myself. 2 Ive been struggling with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation since high school, and it only got worse since then. Im painfully shy and have social anxiety, so its hard for me to make friends or talk to people normally. These events have been taking a toll on me and I dont know how to react. 3 I moved cross country to another state for nursing school with big plans for my life, but dropped out a few months later. I just wasnt doing well and I dont like the profession at all. I do have another bachelors though. But Im now moving back with my parents and its so embarrassing that I feel like a huge failure. Plus, this having a baby thing has been killing my focus and concentration I think","Dropped out of nursing school , got my crazy ldr gf pregnant , I ca nt see my daughter and I struggle with anxiety and depression .

". Also apologies if this breaks any rules. I'm not asking to be diagnosed or anything, just wanting to know what convinced you that you had ADHD. amp Apologies if I offend anyone with this post. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and I feel apprehensive about accepting this diagnosis. I'm curious if anyone here experienced this feeling, and what eventually made you come around. amp I've been seeing some mental health experts and they were quick to say I had ADHD. Like too quick for my liking. It was during our 30 minute intake where the Doc said I was a straightforward case of slipping under the radar as a child. I have a sibling with ADHD too. TBH, this really surprised me because I never really felt ""different""or experienced any of the things I read about here when you all discuss what it was like in school. I was really expecting something like anxiety or depression, because I feel my issues are more recent. I also talked to my sibling about what it's like in their brain, and I just don't relate. On the other hand, a lot of my issues would be very easily explained by ADHD. amp Now I've been on meds for about a week, and I'm not going to lie, I was incredibly focused and motivated the first couple of days. But now I'm sitting here, medicated, with a million tabs open and having trouble powering through one task. So now I'm starting to think it was a placebo effect those first few days. I'm also seeing a therapist on a bi- weekly basis since November, but I don't really feel like I'm getting anywhere with her. She's now really pushing I get involved in group therapy. I'm going to give it a go. amp Maybe I'm being impatient. Maybe I'm being too stubborn and not really listening to the docs. It's just they love to tell me how their practice specializes in ADHD treatment, and that depression anxiety is way tougher to treat, so I can't help but feel like they really WANT me to have ADHD. Sorry this turned into a bit of read. amp","Diagnosed with ADHD and not really buying it atm .

"Edited I forgot to finish the title LOL. But the post explains itself. Anxiety panic attacks obsessive thoughts, looking for other's experiences. So this will be kind of long in effort to give an accurate picture to help my fellow anxiety sufferers help me. A little history - Quit smoking cigarettes a month ago. Quit smoking marijuana 6 months ago although I was never too dependent on marijuana. Had a few restless nights when I quit marijuana, took some benadryl to go to sleep, all was well within a week. Quit smoking cigarettes by going NR and compared to previous attempts to quit smoking, NR has helped a lot. Deeper history - I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD compounded by major depression when I was 12. Trigger of the depression was my folks divorced. GAD and OCD I'm sure always lurked in the wings and really came out with the divorce. Was on several meds up until I was about 15 and my therapist and psych weaned me off of them over time. So for around 10 years I've been med free. When I quit smoking I was slowly flooded with anxiety and obsessive compulsive traits coming back from the depths. The anxiety was is spiraling out of control in to really, really unpleasant panic attacks. I visited an urgent care 8 6 because my GP couldn't see me til today, 8 26. Urgent care rX'd xanax to help me sleep and keep the panic attacks at bay. They're slowly reducing in frequency from multiple attacks a day as of 8 6 to one every couple of days now 8 26. So Things are getting better. In fact, quitting smoking may not be the real issue but the closest convenient target to blame. I have a job I hate working on finding another , planning a wedding, fiance and I are talking about moving, finances are tight, there's just a LOT going on and I think it's more of an ""all these things snowballed just at the wrong time""situation But things are still not right. After a surprisingly long, caring visit with my GP she is going for another month of xanax. She's sending me for labs I'm a pretty new patient for her to check my thyroid she suspects my thyroid may be too high and some other things to see if there may be a thyroid adrenal estrogen progesterone issue at play. If all endocrine panels come back normal and I'm still having panic anxiety obsessive issues she wants to try me on Prozac. I don't generally tolerate SSRI's well, Paxil and Zoloft were just a nightmare. I metaphorically flatlined while taking them and coming off of them was really painful emotionally and to a degree physically brain zaps . She says of the common SSRI's she thinks that Prozac may be a really good fit for me if I can't do Lexapro due to cost I don't have health insurance right now . From what I'm reading Prozac tends to have one of the least severe discontinuation syndromes of the currently available SSRIs. Lexapro being somewhere around the moderate and Paxil being one of the worst I'll never, ever take Paxil again I'll tell you what . I also tend to be on the more sensitive side on the tolerance scale for SSRI's, I've never really tolerated them well on emotional well being against side effects. In fact, even pain killers like Tramadol that act on serotonin can be really troublesome to the point I specifically tell a Dr. that I don't want tramadol, like after a car accident I was in a few years ago. What have your experiences been? Words of wisdom? Advice? Thanks in advance and many well wishes to you all",Ca n't pick myself up by my bootstraps anymore .

"Soo where to start? Im 23 amp been smoking everyday since 17. Started with an ex that always had it, lived with them for 2 years and smoked it all the time amp then we broke up. When I moved back in with my parents is when I actually realised I was addicted. I was friends with the dealers so I had no problems getting any when I wanted it Which was all the time. Recently I got a job as a Carer, knowing full well that I cant get stoned on the job. So for the past year Ive been working 12- 13 hour shifts and as soon as o get home Id smoke a joint. But recently a client passed away amp Ive had a couple weeks off work. During that time Ive smoked like a trooper, probably 1 1 2oz every 5 days. But with time off and the excessive smoking its cost me a fortune. To the point of where Im probably not going to be able to afford food for myself, which leads me to where I am now. Ive got a little bit left, and though Ive not actually tried quitting before I have had to go a few days without it while waiting to pick some up etc, and each time Ive always had troubles sleeping. So the plan is to keep what little I have left to smoke only just before I go to bed. But Im still shitting myself about it and scared that Ill spend money I dont have on the stuff!

"I have recently discovered that I more than likely have ADHD I am waiting to see the specialist after being referred by my doctor and have been reading up on some of the symptoms and quirks of having ADHD. One of the symptoms is that you might blurt out something without thinking and I have been thinking back about some situations where this has happened to me. Years ago but it still haunts me a bit me and a couple of friends used to see someone to buy weed from. He was a very over weight person who used to struggle to leave the house.

Unfortunately this guy died suddenly of a heart attack I think he was only in his late 20's and looking back it upset a couple of friends quite badly.

"Hi! First time posting on this subreddit, I'm very happy it exists. For a bit of background, I'm one of those people who struggled massively in school due to having undiagnosed ADHD, and I still have a lot of trauma and insecurities because of it. Last year I was finally albeit informally, to my frustration diagnosed, but unfortunately it came too late for me to inform my teachers. There were certain faculty members who liked to single me out in class for fiddling while they talked, walking around for no reason, etc, even though I always completed the work they asked for. I should note that I am not medicated beyond using caffeine to self- regulate. amp Anyway, I've now moved courses and campuses, and the new course starts soon. My thinking is that if I mark myself as having a learning disability, it'll get at least some of the teachers to lay off this time. While I hate thinking of ADHD as a disability I need the people around me to understand that I have different requirements in order to get things done, and marking myself as disabled might be the best way to do that. But on the other hand, it may just single me out even further. I'd really, really appreciate some thoughts on what I should do. amp",I struggle to ' behave ' in a classroom setting massively .

"Hello r mentalhealth members! I just wanna share my story, and how my life got to the point it is in now. I'm from the Philippines, and if anyone here is Filipino and struggling, dm me so I can point you in the direction of the people that helped me. When I was 12, I had my first encounter with depressive episodes. I would skip class and I lost a lot of my friends because they really didn't know how to handle someone that emits so much negativity. It was probably better for them to cut that out of life. I cried a lot after school and failing my classes definitely made me feel even worse. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their young lives while I couldn't stay happy for more than a few hours. I was then brought to a psychiatrist who didn't prescribe meds, but instead gave expensive herbal medicines the Philippines has a lot of strange stuff that really didn't work at all. Then I went to another psychiatrist who did not remember my name at all. Every meeting was ""who are you again?""And would charge 3000 pesos 55 USD each meeting. I also started seeing a counselor, who treated me like a baby and made me play with all these toys and used flashcards. Those two didn't work, so scrap that. Then I started to see another psychiatrist who, for the longest time, never paid attention and drugged me so bad I couldn't even function. He was always on his phone, and just gave meds when he heard ""depressed""etc. High school wasn't good either. For the first 3 years, I struggled with bullies and people talking behind my back. These friends I had in middle school turned on me and made fun of me for being depressed and a loser. They never invited me to hang outs and parties because I was too uncool. I even planned a beach trip and everyone ditched because someone planned a party that weekend. Although one day, an upper classman approached me and started talking to me. We got really close and invited me to her birthday party with booze and all. I was hesitant to go because I had no social skills because of my life in the dark. It turned out okay, and then she asked me to prom. I turned it down because I hated myself so much and didn't want to be around people. Fourth year came and I got into vices like drinking and smoking weed. It didn't help. I stopped taking my meds and partied hard. I started self harming, killing cigarettes on my entire body. I drank til I was piss drunk and came home with my mom and dad disappointed. This continued to college where I partied so hard and cut so many classes. I drank everyday and lived away from home so I could do things without my parents knowing. I was always late for class. My smoking got so much worse at 4 packs a day. I then tried to commit suicide one day, but failed. Then one day, my uncle came out of rehab and started talking to my mom. She took me to see the person that changed my uncle's life. He was apparently a family friend, who used to drink and drug with my uncles when they were younger. It didn't take me a long time to get comfortable with him, because he wasn't relying on a textbook to diagnose and help me. He experienced it. And my new psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar type 1. So with the right diagnosis and right counselor, things started to get better. I stayed off drugs and alcohol and kept working on myself with the teachings of the rehab. But it got worse eventually. My mania got so bad that my parents sent me to the psych ward, and then to an inpatient rehab. I spent 4 months with people who hated me because I was young and they constantly judged me and bullied me. It changed my perception of the world. But after I got out, life was different. I was more aware of my condition, I knew how to handle people that pushed my buttons, and my self control was great. I lived the teachings of the rehab and it saved my life. The friends I hurt in college accepted me back and were so happy to see how far i've gone. My parents were overjoyed to see how much I've changed since I started. I always gave myself until 21 to live. I told myself I'd kill myself one day and the world would be happy. But now I'm 20 years old, 2 years sober and it looks like I'll be here for a longer time. Life kicks us down, but if we continue to stand up each time, we'll be rewarded with strength and courage to fight another day. The rainy days teach us to appreciate the sunny ones","I was a mess , suicidal and manic . I have bipolar type 1 and went to rehab , came out a changed man . And the right diagnosis and counseling can make a huge change .","I'm from the Philippines, and I've been through a lot of shit in my life, but I'm here to tell you about how I got to the point I am now, and how I 'll be happy until I turn 21.

"Sorry if this is the wrong place. Long story short, my roommates and I were in a bind and needed to fill the 3rd bedroom ASAP. We met this girl through a Disney Facebook group we al used to work for the company and the first time we met her and showed the room she seemed totally fine. However she did wear a mask and had stockings, a hat, and a long sleeved dress so I didnt notice anything off. My bf did, later that night he said she seems to have lesions and he wondered if she uses meth or something. Me being ignorant and kind - I gave the benefit of the doubt and insisted she probably has psoriasis or something. Well fast fwd to when she moved in. And now Im noticing a ton of signs. - she paid rent AFTER it was due which left us in a bind for 2 days - she said she does not want to be formally added to our lease because she has no credit and she is 27 y o - she has a burner phone and not a real phone - her skin is covered in lesions and scabbing, and its on her face, and she has very red spots acne marks, and bandages all over. - her hair looks brittle and unkempt - the other night she straight up went in and out all night and we saw it on our ring footage and it appeared that she didnt sleep - she randomly sits outside on the sidewalk we live in an apartment in metropolitan Orange County, CA to smoke and read a book and she will sit either there or in the parking garage on the floor near the garbage - her bf is paying for half the rent and basically living here but not living here? Its odd because I dont think hes a user himself but hes definitely a little off, always pacing around and keeping tabs on her - She parked in someones spot that was not assigned to her and her car got towed and she yelled at her bf saying he must have moved the car and not remembered? It was a very bizarre and awkward interaction - she is unemployed and told us she has other forms of income - shes extremely skinny and looks sickly, her skin is kinda aged very slightly, and upon looking at old photos of her she looked WAY different. Much healthier looking a few years ago and now its like a totally different person.

"Hey guys. I'm a newbie her so please forgive me if this is not the right content. I read the side bar and it looks OK! I used to be a heavy smoker when I was younger. Recently I started smoking again - it seemed OK at first but soon escalated to a level which was not compatible with my life. I spoke with my therapist about it and she recommended I begin to make notes about my psychological state around smoking. How did I feel before smoking each day? During? What was my attitude towards it? Was it as pleasant as I thought? This, mixed with active discussion in therapy but also with friends if you can't afford access therapy about what I thought I was getting out of smoking helped me to isolate the reasons I was smoking again. Once I started to see how it was affecting me more clearly, and understand why I was doing it - it became easier to stop.

"I'm sure you guys get a lot of these types of submissions in this sub, but I was just wondering how do I go about communicating with my parents on the possibility of me having ADD ADHD. So I'm 22 years old nearing the end of my college career, and for some reason, I wait until now to wonder if I have ADD. My grades haven't always been the best and procrastination is normal for me. I really started noticing it when living with my roommates, where they would talk to me and I would space out and no my head, but more frequently I cut them off and bring up a new topic altogether, to which my friend replies by saying ""you need to get yourself checked for ADD.""Even during interviews for internships and jobs since it's my senior year, and it's more frequent now I find myself asking the interviewer to repeat him her self a lot. At the end of answering a question I'm always unsure if I answered the question, to which I say ""I hope I answered your question""more often than I should probably have to. Another instance is trying to learn Calculus from last semester, where I literally went through a mental block, and everything I saw and heard went through my ear and out the other, because I couldn't comprehend the complexity of the material. I really want to get this issue addressed because if I really do have it like I think I do, I don't want it to be a liability when I enter my career. My parents honestly think I just have to work harder, and that I'm just not putting forth my best work, even though I honestly try to.

" Background Hello, first- time poster on this sub but I've lurked for a long time. My partner has ADHD- C and this has been a huge resource for helping me to understand him, as someone who like most of the public, unfortunately knew little to nothing about ADHD before meeting him. My partner was diagnosed as a kid and has pretty steadily taken the same meds for a long time, and they work for him. He was is a great student and has a great job where he seems to be greatly respected, especially as an intern. Actual question This has happened occasionally throughout our relationship, but lately it's been happening far more often there are moments when I'll say something to the boyfriend and he'll kind of squint at me funny and say, ""Are you sure you don't have ADD""? He definitely knows what to look for, what with having had it his entire life. That, and the fact that based on a lot of the research I've done, I do fit some of the characteristics. However, I've also been under a lot of stress right now, so how do I know I'm not just looking for an excuse? I'll clarify I do know that ADHD isn't ""just an excuse.""I've done more than enough research, and I understand what it means. What I'm saying is, at what point do you cross from just being someone who at the moment is doing something often associated with ADHD, to realizing that you might actually have it? Especially as an adult who may not consistently have exhibited symptoms until adulthood, at what point do you decide that what's going on isn't normal? About a year ago I was having similar suspicions about having ADHD and mentioned it to my mother, who criticized it as, like I mentioned before, just looking for an excuse. Not that she's unhelpful! I've had depression in the past and while she was a bit critical of that as well despite having had it herself at one point she still got me the help I needed. Right now, when I go through all those online ""Do you have ADHD???""checklists, I'm never quite sure whether I'm just convincing myself that these things are true like when people send those emails telling you ""I bet you can't say the letter 'p' without separating your lips""and you subconsciously have to do it and looking for a way out of a different issue by categorizing it however I can, or if they really are true. How do you know you aren't lying to yourself, one way or the other? I would rather not have ADHD, and I'm sure most people on here would agree but if I do, going on pretending that I don't and letting my grades and social life drop off isn't the best answer","I know the rules say not to ask whether or not to get tested . I 'm not asking that . I want to know , for people who did n't exhibit symptoms as kids but started to as adults , what factor or moment or whatever was the deciding point for you to get evaluated ?","I think I might have ADHD, but I'm not sure if I actually have it or not.

"TW Somewhat unsupportive family members. I wrote on this subreddit a few weeks ago, I am 25, autistic, severly disabled and currently working with my psychiatrists with their diagnosis for me on being borderline. On the 8th of April I finally went to see two specialists in my area. I was so anxious waiting for this appointment. They doctors and all places of the mental health teams in my area have documented all of my phonecalls with the therapists suicide hotlines talkingshops over a period of 4 months probably longer but are now taking me seriously who previously passed me on to these two lovely ladies on the 8th, they have all of my mood boards diaries, and let me talk a bit about my problems during the appointment. I reiterated everything that has been ruining my life for the last 10 years, more noticeable since lockdown staying with my partner at their place on and off since 2019 . I explained how my problems are ruining my relationship, and I have horrible intrusive thoughts that constantly tell a madeup story in my head over and over again. My partner is new to all of this, I tried to best explain it like if someone cannot retell a story or scenario that includes my paranoia, my head will make up worse scenarios and paint whoever it is as a villain. I had such a hard time wording my thoughts and my autism made me go mute several times. After an hour of doing my best to explain, they both mentioned how many of their patients go to googling symptoms, doing research and generally trying to work out what is wrong with them before appointments. I mentioned how I had an inkling it is BPD, due to another family member suffering with it, and how they are misunderstood by our family - yet I understand them perfectly. I mentioned how I feel everyone is out to get me, that my partner is cheating even if there is no physical evidence. They replied that they are shocked, and that I have certainly done my research as that is what it is all leading down to from their personal experiences with me, my notes, and my other therapists. I told my family after the appointment, showed them the written notes from the two ladies and they asked me if this BPD can be removed with medication I was taken aback and explained it is now a part of me. They still don't understand and asked again that I should ask for more professional means of treatement and it's making it harder to deal with, I thought this would get easier with a diagnosis and all but I never realised how bad the stigma truly is. My partner is supportive but it doesn't take away that sting of my parents shrugging it off. I will finally be getting a course of DBT, and maybe even an official written diagnosis so my family can stop calling me emotional","I knew all along something was n't right with myself and that it was n't my autism , I have been diagnosed with BPD by the psychiatrists and I am waiting for a final notice from my doctor to solidify it .

I've been doing ok up until then, haven't been actively suicidal since my ER trip in 2017.

I'm a nurse, and we had a rough weekend at the mental hospital I work at, and by yesterday morning I was sitting on the floor of the med room thinking about just swallowing a bottle of pills and ending it all. I mentioned this to my friend at work, and she was concerned and had kept in contact. I was going to overdose on my new bottle of Trazadone, but thankfully I came to this sub first and learned it most likely would not kill me, so it was not worth it. But it scares me that when I thought I had a means that would let me just fall asleep, I was ready and willing. I did not realize I was that low until that moment. amp But I just dont want to do this anymore. I am sick of feeling like it's never enough. As someone who works in healthcare, I know the stigma on mental illness.

"Trigger warning? For all you ADHDers reading this, this is my college experience with ADHD, may not apply to everyone. I am a recent college grad with ADHD who finished their last semester online in COVID. Three words assignment date flexibility. Have your tests be a 3 or 4 day open time slot which helps with computer malfunctions as well . Any papers, if these students ask for extensions please provide them nicely, they are usually very much needed. Sometimes students are late as in past the due date in asking for extensions, please provide them the same courtesy within reason, give them a day as those students likely severely underestimated the workload and may have also gotten buried in work for other classes. If your grading scheme is such that a student turning in an assignment late gets some amount of partial credit but not full credit, please consider allowing an extension anyway. I spent very important working hours calculating how much I was going to fail by when I could have been finishing an assignment that was already 2 days late. It was all I could think about and it completely ruined my mental well being for the rest of my college career and beyond as far as I can tell as my professors would not respond to my requests for an extension and I was 3 days late on the assignment meaning the highest I could earn was a 72 note how that's what I remember, and not the assignment itself . After having spent a week writing it, 2 other essays, and taking 4 other midterms. Please check your e- mail over the weekends when you have big assignments due, and please please respond nicely. I always hated having to ask for an extension cause it felt like I was failing at the one thing I was supposed to be doing. So words of encouragement if an ADHD student has asked for an extension are very much appreciated, usually they already feel pretty shitty even having to ask in the first place cause it just reminds them they can't do it on their own. If you have a test due, provide a study guide full of relevant information I know my brain at least will stick full force to anything that's interesting and also completely irrelevant . Remember that these students are already often in contact with disability support services or whatever it is at your college and have a lot of these supports already in place, and more. Those people keep records if you have any further questions. Overall, please just be understanding that for a lot of these students. They spent their entire life up until the pandemic learning one way and one way only. People with ADHD make mistakes more often, and take longer to adapt than people without. Be patient with these students, they are likely struggling very hard to get by, particularly if you have any senior ADHDers. I really hope this helps you and any other college professor who happens upon this thread","I had a really crappy class that destroyed me , the professors did n't have a soul , please be a nice person .

"Hi redditors. I have no one else to talk to about this, as my family just acts like I'm whining whenever I bring it up. Almost a decade ago, I was arrested, charged, and convicted of ""battering a cop.""Which in my state is an automatic felony. Never mind that I didn't do it, and was the one who was ""battered""by the officer, or that I have had zero encounters with the law either before or since then. I'm a super clean living, law abiding guy, and just because I got caught up in the middle of a public melee involving a friend, my life gets royally fucked up. I told nothing but the truth in court, yet despite my innocence, the jury just blindly took the cop's word. There was no real evidence on either side. The encounter was not captured on camera. Yet, despite admitting in court that he sustained no injuries whatsoever, the jury still convicts me, and the judge slaps this felony label on me FOREVER. This is effectively a scarlet letter, impugning my character for the rest of my life. The ONLY upside to the whole situation was that my sentence was mostly probation, with less than a month spent in jail. I had just started college at that point, film school actually. It's always been a dream of mine to work in TV and movies. Determined not to give up, I finished my degree, graduating at the top of my class with a stellar GPA. Then I leave school, and can't get ANY jobs at any production companies near me. It's partly because the industry isn't that active in my state, but I'm positive the felony is part of it. I make a small living via a work- at- home internet job, enough to live on my own if I stretched it. Unfortunately, NOBODY is willing to rent to me. They might love me initially, but once the background check comes in, I'm done. So I have to endlessly live with my parents, because I can't find housing that will accept me. I try to seek help from ""ex- offender""places, and everything is tailored toward those with giant rap sheets. I'm sorry, but I am NOT in the same league with murderers and rapists, I don't care what the felon label suggests. What I'd really like to do now is relocate to a place with a more active filming scene, like LA or NYC, since my job can be done from anywhere. The problem is that I can't find housing at any of those places either, and have no friends or family there I could stay with.

"Hello! I am new to this community and am looking for anyones feedback on their experience with the drugs Cipralex escitalopram and Trintellix Vortioxetine and any side effects they have had. 1 month ago my doctor prescribed me 10mg a day of Cipralex. The first week I felt great, no side effects whatsoever and was looking forward to waking up each morning. After a week, I started having some pretty awful side effects. I was sweating uncontrollably, unable to sleep for even 1 hour a night, constant jitters, and worst of them all is I lost my ability to take a full breath or yawn. I constantly feel like Im being suffocated and need to take a full breath. When I try to take a full breath, my lungs fill up 75 but I just cant breathe in anymore. I get the urge to yawn but its as if someone stuck their finger in my mouth mid yawn. The entire satisfying feeling of yawning or just even taking a full breathe has completely gone. It almost feels like the beginning of a panic attack, without any feelings of anxiety whatsoever. I dealt with that side effect for about a week and ended up going to my doctor. He switched me to Trintellix about 4 days ago however I am still unable to take a breath. All other side effects are gone, except my ability to breathe. This is coming in the way of my life as I am gasping for a breathe every 2 minutes.

That night, not only was I raped by one of his now ex best friends after everyone else had left, my ex- best guy friend and I had drunken sex earlier in the night. The whole night was a mess and I regret it immensely, especially because he has a long- distance girlfriend. We had a lot of amazing times, supported each other through ups and downs, and never argued about anything. There were no red flags I could think of during the friendship with him which is why the betrayal came as a shock , except that him and I always had a sense of strong chemistry with each other - however, neither of us wanted to admit to it, and I have no idea how much of that is attributed to simply having a strong friendship and being able to be open. Either way, in hindsight, Im now almost certain that him and I had feelings for each other, and both of us were in denial. In the immediate aftermath, my best guy friend was wholly supporting me with the rape, and told me not to worry about our friendship in the time being, but that we definitely had to create a bit of space between us for a while and create strict boundaries when we hang out again. He made sure I was okay, bought me Plan B, and took care of me. He said that he would do everything he can to support me and make sure that he was available for me to talk to. He also immediately cut all contact with his best friend who raped me without question. At this point, I had no indication that anything would happen between us. A few days after all this happened, his girlfriend moved back here permanently. When she got back, his demeanour and language very suddenly changed and he became very cold towards me. I never saw him again once she got back, and his messages were very withdrawn and limited, though he continued to give support. Out of the blue in the middle of our conversation, I noticed that he had blocked me on text messages and Snapchat. A day after that, he decided to end our friendship completely due to him having cheated on his girlfriend, cut me off and block me on every social media platform - which included not support me regarding the rape situation. In his words, he said - I apologize for saying I would be there and not making good on that. I hope you eventually find peace. Know this is something I have to do. I feel a lot more pain, surprisingly, than the rape itself because its a complete loss of trust, betrayal, and an overwhelming amount of hurt. We were both extremely vulnerable and open during our friendship and he knew how deep my trust issues run, and for that matter we had many conversations about how trust is so important and valuing our closest friends which we were . I felt the most comfortable and 100 myself around him, and given how honest we were with each other, there was no indication of this coming. He then essentially turned around and did the exact same thing that he said he despised in people. I understand why he would have cut off our friendship for his relationship had the rape not occurred, but the fact he essentially decided to leave at my darkest time and never talk to me again is beyond anything I thought a friend could do to hurt me. Im left questioning how genuine anything he said during the friendship was, and how much he actually trusted me. Im wondering where I went wrong. I also question how much of the ending of the friendship is attributed to his girlfriend or whether she directly played a part in the falling out Im not sure how much he told her ","I really need advice on how to make better choices in terms of trusting people again , and how to keep myself safe and guarded moving forward in friendships . Is it possible to forgive him ? Is there any chance of closure or making amends ? How do I start healing and trying to remove any feelings I may have for him ?","I was raped by my best friend s ex - best friend, he cut me out of his life and left me at the worst time of my life, and now I m questioning how genuine he was and how much he actually trusted me.

"Bit of background since its my first post here. I've been dealing with depression off and on for about four years now since I was 17. Complicating things is that I also have autism. I had a break until about a year ago where I had a major relapse. Basically to make things short, I ended up leaving college, luckily I had enough credits to find a loophole to allow me to graduate. I basically have a worthless piece of paper now since I can't do anything regarding my major. I was getting my degree in education and was almost done when depression hit and I realized that mentally I couldn't handle being a teacher. I'm planning on trying to go back to school once I have figured out what career I would do well in. However I have no idea what that could be, I've tried direct care which was a no go, I'm learning that I probably do better in a job where I don't have to talk to people. However now I'm stuck working in retail at minimum wage. I just feel like I'm a failure since I supposed to have a better job and that I just wasted thousands of dollars going to school. I'm at a loss as far as what to do now and could use a hug.

"Hi, I have been depressed ever since 13. Suicide attempts, drugs, taking up religion to try to help me out, isolation, then trying to be social, getting a pet. These are some of the things I've tried. You guys know what I'm talking about. About 6 months ago I fell in love and my world all of a sudden lit up.

"I don't know where to even start but my family dynamic is basically shit right and it has been getting worse. To start off, I despise my brother for what he did to me in the past physically and verbally abuse me and the last thing I would ever do is to to try to comfort someone that has made me suffer. My brother has had anger problems in the past but ever since he joined the National Guard 2 years ago I feel like his anger problems have gotten worse. I don't really talk to him but I overhear conversations between him and my mom about him getting yelled at by his sergeant a lot but that is all I know of his experiences in the NG. I've also heard he was suicidal and thought of shooting himself with a gun. He has caused my parents so much stress and me as well having to see my parents go through this. I honestly only feel pity for him. Right now he is on a trip and visiting my mother's family for 3 weeks to help him relax for a bit but it has gotten worse than when he was at home. My dad set him up with his friend's daughter to hang out and watch a movie but he flaked twice. He complains about being lonely but he pushes people away. The next incident he starts withdrawing from my other cousins and stops talking to them except for my cousin who will will call Gianna . He latches onto her everywhere and will only go out when she goes out. He cries because he believes none of his cousins want to hang out with him but they all have JOBS and LIVES. He thinks he's the center of the world and hearing that just makes me angry. He's the guest first of all and my cousins are not their for him to obey his every whim and needs. My cousin Gianna talked to my dad on the phone and she has been scared for the past few weeks because my brother told her one time he was going to kill himself and asked for the nearest gun store. A recent incident happened yesterday. My dad got a phone call from my aunt who sounded shaken and tearful. Apparently my cousin Gianna didn't answer my brother's text and he proceeded to down a bottle of booze and shattered the bottle and his hands bled and he proceeded to punch multiple holes in the wall. I don't understand what his problem is. I thought him going to the national guard would straighten it out but he has done dangerous things like driving 80 mph on the freeway and getting a ticket driving while being emotional unstable punching holes in the wall and shattering his phone against the wall. This trip was suppose to get him to relax and put an ease on his stress but it's causing my entire family stress. I also feel bad for that girl he flaked on multiple times because she really made an effort to be his friend. I'm worried for my parents because they haven't been able to sleep and my mom has just gotten sick after hearing what my brother has been doing. It's every now and then we get a call from our relatives when shit hits the fan. He's seen some therapists twice but it looks like he doesn't even want help and the only option I see is for him to see a psychiatrist and take drugs. My entire family is so stressed right now and he's there for another two weeks. Please help","Brother is self - destructive , suicidal , depressed .

"Recently, Ive felt very empty hollow. It doesnt necessarily make me feel worse about anything, just that I dont generally have emotions. I still have moments where I can laugh and make jokes and cry but the overall underlying emotion is nothing. Its just so overwhelming to try and have emotions, overthinking about life or philosophy or relationships with people, that that empty void is comforting. When I self harm it helps me stay sane, but I guess its not staying sane if Im just incapable of caring anymore. My relationships with people are on a slow decline because I cant find the strength in me to care. If I do, it hurts my brain and soul and I have to get out, and the only way to do that is to cut. I dont tell my psychologist anything because of difficulties with previous counselors, so I dont know if Im just vying for attention or something is wrong that can be fixed. And even if i do get diagnosed Im worried my relationship with my parents would get even worse. My parents know I used to self harm they thought it was just a little for attention and when I try to open up they tell me I have to toughen up if I wanna survive in this world.

"Hey Reddit, Before I start I want to state that this is not severe at the moment and I haven't lost any money yet but I can feel myself getting addicted to gambling, it all started when I first turned 18 and joined my first 'no deposit' site and won myself 10, I saw how easy it was to win money and though 10 deposit wont hurt, so I deposited, won, and then gambled and ended up winning roughly 30, and I kept depositing more and more, sometimes losing money here and there but recently it has become way more severe and I can feel myself physically shaking when I am on the websites, and if I lose I can 'win it back' I have yet to lose any money but there has been a few close scares for me to lose quite a lot, but if I lose I will always deposit to win back. I am starting a very good job soon which is the most perfect job for me and I am so excited, it is good pay and I know that if I don't quit gambling now I know for a fact a lot if not all of the paycheck will be going onto gambling, I can't force myself to stop, for example yesterday I won 150, which to me is a lot of money at the moment and I said to myself your ahead just quit, the casino will find ways of winning it back, yet this morning I went to check my account and I though 10 of it wont hurt, lost, another 10, another 10, then 30, then another 30, and altogether ended up losing about 110 in a matter of seconds, and I am sat here wanting to go back and win the money which was oh so easily won yesterday but I cant!

"I was never a good student, also I always hated school. When I was in elementary school, I remember crying literally every time during first grade when I went to school, I absolutely HATE it. It's the worst fucking thing a person has to do. I love learning new things and applying them in the real world but I don't like school, I'm just not good at it. My grades were always terrible during 1st to 12th, I was always a mediocre student, I never got the grades my parents and teachers told me ""I had the potential to"". And now what? I somehow slipped through the cracks and found myself in college because I had no fucking choice. I mean, I had, but literally everyone told me it was the best way to get a job and that ""it would be the best time of my life. I would get a girlfriend and studying would be awesome"". Being the idiotic loser I am, I believed, and instead could have gone to a trade school and gotten something way better out of my life. I would probably have a girlfriend, a house, a car and a way bigger level of happiness if I chose something that ""wouldn't get me a better job than college"". But now here I am lonely, getting horrible grades like never before and literally no will to live. I also never had a girlfriend. I watched as all my friends got into and out of relationships, while I remained alone. Lately, all my dreams are about being with a girl, cuddling and kissing her. My mood dies when this happens. I think about this literally every second, even when I'm drunk as shit I had something with a girl last summer. I had sort of a crush on her, she was so cute and so pixie. I never though she'd turn out to like me in return, but she did. One month later after we started our little ""thing"", she told me she never liked me in return and still loved her ex and well here I am. I'm dying inside with each passing day.

If someone read this they would feel sorry for me because of the sadness I endured, but I never felt sadness. The only thing I felt after seeing her bed- ridden was envy. All I thought about was ""why the fuck didn't I get cancer instead of her? She was so happy with her life, she had the biggest joi de vivre I've ever seen in someone. We don't deserve this, she doesn't deserve to die while I don't deserve to live. WHY! ?"".

"Neurodev means we see it way earlier in childhood, and is pervasive. ADHD is also more likely to come with sensory processing issues, learning disorders . Cluster B disorders are often developed in childhood but have more of the emotional symptoms rather than the attention issues we see in ADHD. For instance, BPD is unlikely to lose their keys to the point of needing a geotracker, and alternate history is not the same as literally forgetting what happened It does leave for a lot of overlap, and I do see that clinically. Most everyone feels better on stimulants, so that doesnt help. Theres some notable differences with some presentations that are super confirmatory that I wont get into for patient anonymity and because Im working on case reports. For cluster B issues theres often a family history of personality disorder or abuse, which may or may not be present in ADHD. PTSD can look the same as well but my grown ups can usually say it happened after xyz if the history is careful enough, and theres usually emotional flooding or flattening in a good history.

"So I've been hearing this at meetings a lot lately. When people talk about sponsorship they embrace being told that they're simply a ""garden variety drunk.""Many of these people have a long time in recovery. I have a little over 16 months sobriety and this phrasing is starting to bother me. First off, I feel that taking this approach is detrimental for the newcomer. While we celebrate their arrival and encourage their commitment to the program, we are seemingly dismissing not only them, but also ourselves and our fellowship as being innately hopeless, when the reality is that many of us are recovering and have recovered from alcoholism. While we certainly felt hopeless during active alcoholism, we have discovered a power greater than ourselves that not only restores us to sanity, but also empowers us to be productive, helpful, and understanding individuals that contribute not only to our society of alcoholics, but also to humanity as a whole. To me, accepting life as a ""garden variety drunk""seems to trigger that same sort of self- pity that our program promises to absolve us from, and certainly seems to instill greater self- pity or shame in the newcomer. I believe that although many of us have had similar experiences and can certainly relate to each other in ways that other people cannot, we truly can never know exactly how another person feels, thinks, or why they behave certain ways. Labeling ourselves ""garden variety drunks""may be used in a bastardized attempt at creating unity amongst us, but I feel that its negativity is detrimental to our groups and most importantly to the newcomer. After Step One, the program of AA becomes entirely empowering. Relying on a god of our understanding and helping others distances and protects us from taking that first drink of an uncontrollable many. Yes we have suffered from the disease of alcoholism, but individually we are far from a ""garden variety drunk.""One of the most beautiful parts of our fellowship is its diversity and its ability to bring people of different race, class, gender, age, and in fact, different experiences together into a generally harmonious setting","I think people deeming themselves and our fellowship ""garden variety drunks ""is harmful to the newcomer because this negative language perpetuates the hopelessness of the alcoholic rather than embracing the spiritual empowerment we receive through the 12 steps .

I think i improved quite a lot actually. My first trip to ER happened in june 2011 and its been almost 2 years without any medications and therapists. Just will power and exercising. I still need to push myself to defeating fear of my physical symptoms and some minor fear of being in crowded place like in a church or a concert. I'm not too sure if you experienced this or not but i also had really compulsive thoughts for a bit too along with depression. I believe these happen from constantly dealing with anxiety,"while my anxious level has gone down tremendously i still suffer from physical symptoms like stiff neck , chest discomfort and fatigue throughout the day But i do believe i m getting better overall .

"So as the title suggests, I have been experiencing performance anxiety recently when playing video games. When I feel like whenever I lose to an enemy, they laugh at me when in reality they probably don't even care. I used to have a lot of confidence last year but this year my anxiety has gotten a lot worse and it makes playing video games competitively harder. Some techniques I try to use are to treat the game not too seriously but it doesn't work most of the time.

"I 19m was diagnosed with ADD ADHD about 7 years ago during my second year of high school. I was given medication to help me focus during class and on my schoolwork. I only took my medication on schooldays and when I had to do homework. So usually I was off of it on weekends holidays. At the time I thought I only required the medication to be able to focus on larger projects, and that I didn't need it to function as a normal human in today's society. Boy was I wrong. Start September I enrolled in University but dropped out rather quickly because I realized the study wasn't for me. I had been off my meds the entire summer and figured that if I didn't go to school I wouldn't need them. However taking an unplanned gap year with nothing planned other than working part time and moving out of my parents house was a lot harder than I expected. I had also taken a gap year the year before to get certificates for high school chemistry and physics because they were part of the admission requirements. I dropped these subjects in high school to be able to get reasonable results on my exams because it was simply too much for my scattered brain to handle at the time. Since I was still somewhat busy studying for the certificates I was on my meds from October till May in the first gap year. So having already technically taken a gap year I thought I knew what I was up against. HOWEVER, from October onward second gap year I started steadily deteriorating. Work and my social life started weighing heavier and heavier on my day to day functioning. And by the time it was January I quit my job because it simply felt like it was too much to handle. At this time I became so overstimulated that I had to drop my social life as well because I had no way to process the input that came with that. Intense over stimulation came with intense derealization and mild auditory visual hallucinations. I didn't know what the frick was going on and I went to go see my doctor who, based on the auditory hallucinations, put me on anti psychotics. This only made matters worse to the point where I dissociated to a point where I couldn't speak or move yet still hear and see what the people around me were doing. I visited my doctor again and he suggested I started taking my methylphenidate again. This worked like a charm. the moment I started taking them again I finally felt able to take in the world around me and my head got a lot lighter. My hallucinations stopped and I was able to go outside and talk to my friends again without completely shutting off. I realized that without the meds I have no filter for all the things happening around me and no capability to focus on one thing at the time. This results in me taking in everything at once and over time that just became to much to handle and my brain started shutting everything out as a result. Overall this was a horrible experience but it has taught me what my medication does for me, and why I need it. I've accepted that I need meds as a helping hand to be able to do things people without ADHD just do by themselves. Oh, and I'm able to focus on bigger tasks now, which is nice. I think because I've been taking meds since I was 12 I never really learned what it's like to not take them while dealing with all the stress of being a young adult. amp",stopped taking my meds during my gap year and got really overstimulated . realized that the meds do n't just help me do my homework but also allow me to focus on one thing at a time and create a filter so that i do n't take in everything at once .,"I've been on my meds since I was 12, took a gap year with no planned plans and now I'm able to function as a normal human again.

"I've 30M had a long distance friendship with a girl 21F for a couple years now. We haven't met in person but have had many video chats, talks on the phone, etc over the years. She starting dating a guy 21M a couple years ago and recently it has gotten bad. I've always known him to be manipulative, mean, and downright untrustworthy. However, she has said she has fallen in love with him. Despite that, she also has told me she has thought about breaking up with him on a few occasions due to how unhappy she is with him but she ""can't""due to being scared he will ""kill her""if she does and also she is afraid of being alone. Her and I have discussed the possibility of dating at some time in the future and she has acknowledged interest but has to ""figure out what to do""regarding her current relationship. Last weekend it got bad, she was drunk and they got in a physical altercation which included a gun being pulled by him he has also allegedly conveniently pulled the gun out ""just to clean it""whenever she has tried to have serious conversations with him . I told her this guy is NO GOOD. That he has been gaslighting her for a year now and making her feel like she will be nothing without him, indirectly intimidating her into staying with him, trying to control her every move, etc. She says she can't break up with him due to being scared and not sure if she wants to but I believe this is all due to the brainwashed spell he has over her. I've tried to convince her to leave and so have her mother and brother but she won't listen. I've offered to help her any way I can. I offered to pay for a flight to get out of town safely and stay with me until she decides what she wants to do, offered her other local support options like police, and encouraged her to continue to talk to her mom and brother about it she doesn't like talking to them about it . Is there anything else I can do? I don't want to and know I can't push her or force her to get away from that man but I'm worried he will seriously hurt her.

"After benignly googling some behaviors of mine after a particularly difficult first year at college to put it lightly , I came across a webpage about ADHD. I thought to myself that I couldn't possibly have it. I had diagnosed anxiety, OCD, and depression I couldn't possibly have this. ADHD was a mental illness that several rambunctious boys in my grade school obviously had, but not me, often commended for my calm behavior and good grades. ampnbsp I was convinced I was just lazy and depressed and that I needed to motivate myself to be more mindful of my possessions, motivate myself to do daily tasks and work, start early on projects. But it was never that simple. Color coding everything and downloading every organizational app under the sun never improved my forgetfulness and my procrastination. I put off 4, 10- 12 page papers that had been assigned day one of a class until the week they were due. I was constantly asking for homework extensions, even with a set homework schedule in most classes. My finances were in shambles. I felt like this was all my fault.

"Hello together, it's my first time posting here because I have a serious question. I started an apprenticeship as confectioner this september and it's the best that happened to me since January. I've been unemployed since march because I lost my first apprenticeship because of my ADD, and these months were really shitty. I like the work that I do, all my colleagues are really nice and for some time I only got positive feedback. I could include myself really fast into the department and learn very fast the things to do. But today, one of my favourite colleagues and one of my main instructors had a long talk with me after work about my performance since November. Some other colleagues talked to me too about it but never so long. The problems are the ""typical""ADD problems. I forget little things that I should know for example when cleaning a machine, I often clean 90 and forget 10 but now always the same parts, always something else , I work too slow or not so fast as I should work with 3 months at work there, and he said that it looks like I'm constantly hakf asleep. I told him then that I got diagnosed with ADD and he was very understanding and said, that I just should tell the colleagues because they are a bit negative towards me because of my lack of workpower. He also said, that nobody will judge me for it, himself has tics and nobody has ever teased him because of it. He said they all will be more understanding than judging. Now my question how to tell my colleagues about my ADD? What shoud I say?

"My parents were really despeate to help me become healthy. I was agoraphobic at the time and after talking too a bunch of therapists with different titles they sent me to the hospital for testing.

"I did not read this from the original post. To equate those things takes quite some ""thinking in extremes""tbh! And this also feeds directly into the stigma of BPD. ""PwBPD is needy and will just blame everyone else"". NO. It IS very misunderstood and I see hear people really taking a lot of easy ways out, not wanting to even TRY to think about it, even when there's loved ones in their lives who suffer from it and would already greatly benefit from ppl just TRYING.. I try to understand others' issues, even if i don't face them myself, like it's not hard at all to do that without thinking I have to solve their shit?! Same goes for myself pwBPD I have to deal with my own shit, have to learn to do so if I lack this ability, knowing that everyone struggles in their own lives for a plethora of reasons, but I get to have ppl in my life who love me nonetheless, who will sometimes make an effort to GET IT, who are able to see me beyond my symptoms. Makes establishing boundaries easier too at least in my experience . Fact, ""nobody gives a shit"". There's even enough professionals who apparently don't. To find the therapist I have rn took forever and a lot of pain and working my butt off to even be heard. The one I have now has already helped me immensely, tho.

"I was dating a wonderful man for about a month, but had been talking with him more as friends for a couple months prior to that. He has so many qualities I want in a partner and I felt a good, fundamental connection with him. I found him cute and enjoyed being physical very much although I never really felt a 'head over heels' feeling for him. He completely accepted me and liked me very much. He is the first person I have dated in years and the first person in a very long time that I felt had great long term potential. Very soon after we began dating I got horrible anxiety and would think about breaking up with him constantly. I would get tightness in my chest and would think over and over that we just had to break up, although I was not certain why. It intensified as we started sleeping over with each other and then having sex. We eventually ended things after one of my anxiety episodes since we were both feeling horrible about how I would get anxious with him.

At the end of last semester I was close to failing and had to ask for extensions on a few final papers as I put them off and had trouble mustering the ability to get them done. I even had to ask one of my professors to take a final a few weeks late. I pretty much failed that test, but fortunately the professor was nice and gave me a good grade. I had good grades in school growing up and I go to a university in the state thats pretty well- regarded. Though, since I was a child Ive never been able to finish a book for fun because after a few minutes I pretty much cant focus anymore, which is problematic because reading is a big focus for my major. The councilor at the office said I was a textbook case, but I come to see the psychiatrist a few weeks later and heres how it goes He comes in asks me about my grades and the school I go to, says its just anxiety from being at a competitive university and that most people have a difficult first semester and that stimulants ruin peoples lives and that he doesnt like prescribing medication. It was about 10 minutes and no testing was done or anything like that. I felt like he just blew me off. What should I do at this point? I just want help with these issues because it feels like Im really wasting my time in school because I always feel behind and like I cant get anything done",I m a college student who s been having persistent trouble studying and focusing .

"Just to preface this, I'm not suicidal but I've been really depressed for years. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for 8ish months and it doesn't seem to be helping at all, I really just don't see any of this getting better. Sorry for the wall of text. Ever since I was a young child I've been ignored by my family, my older brother has a history of mental issues and hit me when we were young. He was kicked out of public school due to his abusive nature and because I was his brother and socially awkward from the abuse I was seen as a threat as well and also ended up getting kicked around around age 7. I was placed into schools for troubled children Mostly gang family abuse cases and for the most part grew up away from home in these places. It's hard to put into words but I honestly believe I was kept there longer because I didn't cause any real issues. I never got into fights or caused arguments and I'd be perfect for 9 months to a year and then ask when I would be allowed to go home. They would then list all the things I would need to work on which typically included being more social The thing is that I was surrounded by a bunch of miscreants that I wanted nothing to do with. I was intentionally not socializing with them. After hearing this I would break down and stop following the rules and I'd almost immediately be transferred somewhere else. I'll spare you the details but this goes on for close to 10 years. At moments I was physically harmed, including being pinned to the ground and having my wrists ground into the gravel causing baseball sized scabs to form. All this happened under my mothers control. Most people in these situations have been put there by a court order as they have done some type of crime, but I had done no such thing. I was there because my mother chose for me to be there and she refused to let me come home. She refused to listen to a word I said or believe anything I said as the truth and instead believed the staff's lies at these facilities. I eventually got released only because I got put in one facility that apparently wasn't corrupt. I had been there about 4 months and as usually had done nothing wrong and the next thing I know I am in a meeting with one of the head staff in charge of the facility asking me why I am there. I simply tell them that I honestly don't know. Apparently that was a good enough answer. The problem with all of this is that during all of this I was not taught basically anything academically. I'm currently in college and have been for about 3 years and I've been failing everything I take due to a combination of depression, anxiety, and lack of knowledge and understanding. I honestly don't know what to do with myself. I can't just drop out because that would mean moving back home with my mother and I can't continue cause I've been trying as hard as I can. Even with tutors I simply can't do it. I was force fed medications my entire childhood and I'm starting to think they impaired my brain development or something. I can't retain information. I don't have friends because I can't connect with anyone. No one can understand what I've been through, they can only sympathize. I don't need someone who can sympathize, I need someone who understands me for once. I just wish I could start over","My life was messed up and I do n't know what to do about it anymore .

"I see a lot of posts that ask ""how do you know if a med is working?""I think I've found mine so I thought I would share. Background this is the 3rd I've tried. I went from Concerta 18mg Concerta 27mg Concerta 27mg 5mg Ritalin IR booster twice a day three hours apart Just Ritalin IR 7.5mg at 9am, noon, and sometimes another 5mg at 3pm Back to taking Concerta 27mg only Vyvanse 30mg SO WHY DO I FEEL LIKE ITS WORKING? smoother medication transition when it starts.

Depression started in junior year 2nd to last year of high school. Ever since high school, happiness was and is never but a fleeting glimpse I feel perhaps once a year. Objectively, my life seems content and this sounds like a ""first world problem"". I graduated from an Ivy League school. No, my parents are not rich and or powerful. Their income has always been below 500 a year and I survived off of soup and bread and worrying every week about money. Mon- Fri was literally sleep, eat, study, and work with no human contact besides the minimal of formalities in conversation at lecture. I got used to it after a while. But now, I'm admitted to one of the top medical schools in the US. And yet, I feel no happiness or relief. The two or three friends I have are gone, enjoying life and or starting their family. I'm working now over 70 hours a week to support my parents. One of them is disabled mentally and physically.

"I figure I should start this with who I am. I am a 20- year- old female, I live with my mother now while I'm working through college. She's really sweet and has always been great to me and my older siblings. I am 10 years younger than my siblings, who are step brother sister, but they're also great so it never came between us. My family grew up with an abusive father, my sibling's biological dad was terrible and my biological dad is just as bad. this has relevance to the story Well, my family worked all the time, my dad went through a serious surgery, in which he almost died. So he was laid up and couldn't watch me, mom worked all day, and my siblings moved out by this time. My neighbor, who lived directly in the house beside us, would babysit me. The mother was a decent friend to my parents and the son of this woman shared a name with a little boy who lived in that same house, but moved out. I, being about 7 at this time, associated the little boy I was friends with to the older teenage boy who the same first name. let's call him John So, every now and then John would babysit me and, for the most part, his mother would be there too. I liked being able to keep going to my friend's home, even if he wasn't there anymore. Overtime, his mother had to take up another job to pay their bills, all my dad told me is that John would be watching me now and that I should do what he says. My mom, as I said, was almost always working. After the first few days of being alone with John, those days filled with a weird feeling because I can still remember him staring at me, leering over me, and just being more playfully physical with me than he had ever done when his mom was home. I wasn't very attuned to what this meant of course, I just wanted to play games and enjoy my time away from my dad who, despite his recovery, still managed to be just as harmful. So going over to John's place was a tremendous relief, for a while anyways. About the fourth day all of that ended quickly, I was going to be staying for a prolonged period of time that day, more so than usual as my dad was staying for the majority of the day at the doctor's hospital. At this point I was getting a bit nervous of John at this time, he would be more touchy feely in a more literal sense. I was uncomfortable, but didn't think anything more of it. This day I went to John's and he was standing at his door, welcoming me inside which wasn't normal. I would usually just walk in the garage door. the garage was an open garage, no walls or garage door He started off more physical and ushered me further into the house, where I had not actually been before. The house was small, but just like my house, there was a hallway that lead to the bedrooms and I never went down there, not even when my friend lived there because even his mom thought it was inappropriate. I didn't think about this at the time and had no idea what was going on. I can see now I was very sheltered and, as any 7- year- old is, trusting of just about everyone. My mom did give me the ""Don't talk to strangers""talk, but John wasn't a stranger and I was told to listen to him, so I didn't think it applied. We were in the furthest bedroom, which I suppose is his or his mother's room, and he locked the door behind us. I was confused and asked why we were here, that I wasn't allowed back here. He just told me it was okay and to trust him, which I did, but still felt strange in an unfamiliar place. He acted like he was tired or overheated and began to undress himself, talking me through that like it was a normal thing. I didn't know much better, other than I didn't like it, and just stood away being quiet. John came up to me and started telling me that I should get undressed with him, that I would feel better, and that, again, I should trust him. I didn't do what he said and said that I didn't want to, but he just told me that if I didn't do what he said he'd tell my parents that I wasn't listening to him and how I was being a bad girl, etc. etc. I was scared of my dad and I didn't want to get in trouble with either him or my mom, so I reluctantly started taking off my own clothes and, when I was in nothing but my underwear, he started overlooking me, telling me how good I looked, saying that I must feel better and he knew I would. I was so scared and worried I felt sick, but I didn't speak up. He started getting closer and physical with me again, running his hands over me, and just saying stuff quietly, more how happy he was that I was there with him, how nice I looked, and how good I felt. Eventually he just picked me up and put me on the bed, I was still crying and scared, everything was making it worse and I wanted out so bad. The room was darkened by the curtains, I was trying to push his hands off of me, but he got rougher and acted meaner towards me. Saying how I was a big baby and should let him do what he wanted, that I had to do what he said, and how he would make me feel good . A few moments of this and he pushed me onto the push and held me down on the bed to where it hurt and I tried to push back, but he was stronger and started touching me in the worst places, before telling me that I was going to ""enjoy this because it would make him feel good too.""He started to rape me with so much force I felt like there was a knife in my stomach constantly just stabbing me and though I tried to cry, kick, and scream, he just covered my mouth and I had no way to escape. When he was done, he forced me into a shower and dressed me himself. I wasn't very responsive, so I just accepted everything that happened. He told me that I shouldn't tell anyone, because if I did, my parents would be mad at me and ground me. I still had a more overpowering fear of my dad and so I didn't say anything. When I finally went home, I just stayed in my room and cried. This continued for a long while, I would go to John's house, even though I kept trying to get out of it, and John would do this or other things to me until one day I just had to tell someone. I didn't want to hurt anymore so I told the only person I could. I tried to tell my dad one day, about a month or two after it started, but he only said that I was a liar, a complaining bitch. Even when I attempted to stress it to him that I wasn't lying, he told me that I was a whore and probably deserved it. Still being 7, started to believe in what he and John both said. So I didn't try to tell my mom, when my brother and sister came to visit at times, I didn't say anything about it. I kept to myself and never wanted to tell anyone, especially the people I actually liked, because I didn't want them to think badly of me or be mad at me. After months passed, things got worse, to where John had, on a few occasions, invited his friends over who would do about the same as John did, but none of them were as bad as John. About a year and a half to two years later, John and his mother moved out and I've never seen or heard from them again. I was so happy when they left, that I wouldn't have to deal with them again. My mom had better work hours within the first year, but my dad was too lazy to work and my mom did have a 9 to 5 job, so I was still babysit by John until he left. I wanted to tell someone this, with the comfort of anonymity, because I tried to date someone recently, who turned out not to be the best kind of person, but not a bad person either. I thought I could handle anything that came my way, but when I was around him I had so many problems. I was jumpy, nervous, anxious, and just all around on full alert. Not to mention that, even after John left, I still have nightmares, about him, his friends, my dad, and they keep me up still. I'm 20 now and my mom and I moved out, away from my dad, and we live rather happily. I love my new home, I love my mom. I can't function normally though, I get startled easily, I tried to hang out with my best friend and one of her guy friends who is now also my friend , I thought I wouldn't have any problems again. However, whenever he was close by I was nervous, almost like I expected him to hit me in public for no reason. I know it's ridiculous, the idea is just plain nonsense. I even tried to initiate physical intimacy with my now ex boyfriend, which we did, but I couldn't find any enjoyment out of it. I felt like I was just sitting there waiting for it to end. I don't know if I can handle this stress enough to have a relationship with a guy, or if I should just date a girl, if I can do that much. I don't know, I need help, I never told anyone much about it. I told my best friend and my boyfriend I was raped, but never anything more than that really. I can't sleep, I can't relax outside of my home, and I just want to know what I should do. I don't have a lot of money, as I only work part time, so I can't afford any counseling. I have read so many stories on this subreddit, people who've been through things like I have and it made me sad to read about people in those situations too, but the comments were so helpful and seemed so accepting. I'm sorry if this is blocky or vague, I was young, but I have spent a very, very long time thinking about these events. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry about the long read I haven't told anyone this, so I figured it best to detail the best I could.

"So I'm writing this in order to hopefully get give some information to those interested in ketamine infusions. I'm diagnosed major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder, which has affected me for the last 13 years. Lately it has reached levels where I've lost the will to live, which led me to ketamine after a referral from my psychiatrist who finally deemed that ""meds don't work for me apparently.""I received my first infusion Monday, which was a bizarre experience. As someone with experience with ketamine, this was along the lines of what I expected, although the body load was quite intense. It actually was uncomfortable for a long period of time which led me to question the possibility of it working. All day yesterday I was restless and uncomfortable, only sleeping for two hours during the night and not feeling so hot today. Today was my second infusion. I spoke to the doctor and told her that the first infusion was uncomfortable, and she agreed to keep the dosage the same, but infuse for a longer period of time. The treatment overall was wayyy less uncomfortable although I didn't leave there feeling much relief, if any at all. I've actually felt quite revved up again today, and my anxiety was definitely aggravated in social settings. She also told me to hold out until the third of fourth session before we gauge if I'm experiencing any relief from the infusions or not. Overall I haven't felt much relief, if anything, some of my symptoms have become aggravated. Has anyone else experienced this type of effect and later found the treatments to work? Or was your relief somewhat of an immediate effect, where you can tell from the first or second session that the infusions were successful which is what a majority of what I've read has said ? Thanks! ","I received my second ketamine infusion today and still have n't experienced any relief .

"Hi Reddit, So here's a little background about me. All my life I've lived with mild depression and anxiety. I'm very high functioning in society so it's nothing that's really stopping from living life to the fullest. But because of my personal understanding of mental health I was always someone that could easily relate to other people that even have it worse. I understand that mental health issues doesn't define who a person is and I can see who they are for real and not what they are presenting on the surface. Despite sometimes having negative thoughts in my head I sure know how to be positive and cheer up people. I wanna volunteer my time to help people live a fuller life. The problem is I don't know where to look. I just wanna make a difference in this world, one person at a time. Any ideas what I could do to help in my community. Non- profits, help- lines, hospitals, etc?

"I seem to have the uncanny ability to forget my most important items in places, even when I set my other bags on top of them so I see them when I pick them up? I was at my parents' for Thanksgiving and I had to bring my work bag. I was worried that I would forget it when I went home and surprise surprise Monday morning rolls around and I realize I don't have my bag. Somehow I didn't see that the most important thing I needed for my job was in a pile I had stacked in the room I was staying in. So I had the pleasure of using one of my limited sick days to wait for my brother to ship my computer to me. I have a lot of anxiety about leaving things in places and whenever I have a bag that I don't normally travel with and I'm out somewhere sitting down I will literally wrap one of the straps completely around my foot so that I will trip if I leave it. I think my most harrowing instant was in undergrad when the very nice oboe I was renting, I somehow left under my desk in my math class, and I did not realize until the end of my next class all the way across campus. So after a very stressful walk I saw that it was still there, but having to pay the full 3000 cost to replace that instrument and then not even get to own it would have devastated my financially and emotionally as a poor college student. I thought I was past all this, but I guess not! Also I meant to post this earlier but then I started watching the Crown and stayed up until 5am and here we are!

"No matter what the circumstance, if I have to call out of work, I feel a tremendous amount of guilt. I'm talking insurmountable. Enough to make it entirely not worth it, enough to leave me sick for lengthy periods of time because I won't call in. Despite all odds, I have been ""stable""for almost a year now. I've held a job, officially, for over a year. I plan to continue working at the organization and I'm an important member of the team, somehow. I'm terrified of my responsibilities, but after almost a decade of treatment plans, I have enough resources to deal with recovery as best I can. Over the course of this past year, I only called out for a few mental health days. Every time I did, and times when I've done it at past jobs, I either lie or come clean. Lieing makes me feel like shit, but sharing my truth is anxiety provoking as all hell. But this time I decided to tell my boss. And for the first time, I feel like my message was actually well worded. I still feel a level of anxiety and nervousness but I don't feel ashamed and I don't feel as guilty. And to me, shame and guilt are far more destructive than anxiety of course, this is only in my personal experience . If anyone wants me to PM the email I sent as an outline I'd be happy to do so.

"So basically, I didnt get any sleep last night. Zero hours. I desperately needed sleep since I didnt want to look like a troll for the pictures I needed to have taken of myself at the crack of dawn. I would never schedule myself for anything earlier than 11 AM this was clearly someone elses decision I I took my medicine I think around 5 6 AM and when I got home I decided that I wasnt going to take anymore. I dont know why, I guess I was feeling super confident about getting ready to go to class on time. Which I didnt but I was only 4 minutes late and the professor for this particular class is super lenient. Anyway the size of the class is small which is great because its easier to socialize in small groups and despite my medication causing me to become progressively more antisocial Ive gotten along well with others in the class. Plus the professor is freaking hilarious. Hes like a funny uncle grandpa thats always busting our balls. Well today my medicine wore off early and even though I was really tired, I joked around with everyone and I didnt feel awkward. I stumbled on my words a few times but I didnt feel bad about it.

"I have suspected a diagnosis for years. At least 2 of my kids have a diagnosis the other 2 are too little to really tell yet. One of my siblings was diagnised as a teen and it traumatized him and he used it as an excuse to give up and drop out of High School. He never went back. He had a falling out with my parents while I was away at uni. He came to my wedding 12 years ago and I havent seen him since. My other sibling absolutely has some kind of deleted word because auto mod but will never see a mental health provider for anything other than suicidal thoughts. Post partum was really hard on her. I found out several years after her diagnosis that my Mom was diagnosed in her 50s. She also admitted to me that she was suspisions that I had a problem when I was a teen but because I got good grades and because my brother basically gave up on life starting with his diagnosis my parents were afraid to have me evaluated. Covid hits and after months of working at home my wife finally convinces me to seek a formal Diagnosis. At 37 I get confirmation of my suspicion and now I take aderall. The dose is not dialed in yet but we are working on it. At this point I am only seeing an NP through a mental health clinic. In our most recent visit I told her that the anxiety is much better but not gone and task avoidance hasn't changed still a huge problem . I asked if an anti depressant would be beneficial and she won't prescribe one. She emailed me a list of therapists. I have had symptoms of anxiety and depression since middle school. I have been in therapy multiple times I have been on anti depressants multiple times. I have seen therapists that I would give a one star review on yelp. And some that would get four stars. More 1s than 4s I told my wife I am not going to read the email. That is one thing that pissed her off. I told her if thearapists were worth a shit I would have gotten diagnosed much sooner in life. That is another thing that pissed her off. In many ways I have just fallen through the cracks for 4 decades. I was 400lbs when I graduated high school. Attempted suicide once in HS and once in college. The time it happened in college I ended up doing a 3 day volunteer stay in an inpatient psyche ward. It was the weekend so I saw the doc once in 3 days. It was basically a place to baby sit the people that werent stable enough for jail or drug addicts waiting to call their dealer. Basically got no help other than making sure I didn't actual off myself. Went back to school on a med that I forgot the name of, but it made it so simple to switch in and out of executive functioning that I could actually do school work for the first time ever or since. I had to stop taking it because of side effects constant flop sweats, and could only sleep for about 2 hours max with an 18hr gap in between I did therapy one other time after I got married. Had a job that made me horrifically depressed. My ADD I do not present with hyper activity made me a terrible fit for the job. After a while I was happier the day before the appointment and would be miserable the three days following a session. I have spent so much of my life working so much harder that typical people to compensate for my differences. While actually acomplishing less. I have sought help so many times and most of them ended negatively that I just do not have the energy any more. Covid has put my job in danger along with poor management in the C- Suite . I just do not have the energy or the desire to put in any more effort in my treatment. That pissed off my wife as well. I am tired I am burned out I am nearly 40 and have not really achieved any of my life goals and at this point I would be shocked if I ever do. I work more hours than a typical person would for the same result. I should be job hunting hard but I do not have the energy. I am tired and I have kind of given up. I dont have any friends.

Household income has essentially no room for entertainment that isnt internet or streaming services. I have 4 kids ages 10yrs. to 1yr. So very very little free time. I have no hobbies because no time and no money. My wife told me I should go into therapy for her and the kids I said why it doesn't work. That really pissed her off. If I dont do it she might kick me outright now not sure I care. I have worked so hard to compensate for so much in life that I just don't have enough energy or desire or patients to go through the months or years it will take to get results from therapy. I think its all bullshit anyway. Just me spending money I don't have on guess work and medicine I cant afford.

"Hey Reddit, been another year since my last post on here. Things actually have improved in my life. My work leveled out and I took a promotion that I'm doing pretty well at. My wife and I have been doing excellent, and I have even been helping her deal with her depression. Then holiday season came. Starting mid October my depression came like a run away freight train. I'm used to the every once in a while I'll have a bad day, but since October its been everyday. The anxiety is back as well. I feel as if I am constantly under attack. Full on Fight or Flight response. My boss can even see it in my eyes when it happens. Now I am just tired. Everyday I feel this dread and emptiness. Last night after closing and locking up the store I told my wife that I was gonna go for a drive to clear my head. I drove to a lake that is in my town and next to a busy highway. With it being dark, I turned both the interior and exterior lights off on the car and just sat on the back and stared at the water and tree line. It was so tranquil. The occasional hoot of an owl, the splash of a fish, and the chirps of a cricket. I instantly started feeling more at ease, then I made the realization. The tranquility of nature, and the violence of modern life. The sounds of nature were droned out by the sound of cars and trucks continuing on their own busy lives.

"I'm 17 and I recently moved out of home away from my mother. I am 4 hours away from home, but I live with my boyfriend. I'm not sure how judgement you are on this subreddit I know I am young, but I am no longer suicidal, so I think moving out was for the best. I used to not be able to order my own food, or ask for help, or be able to talk to someone I'm not close with. My boyfriend has helped a lot with my anxiety, I can now do those things. Of course, I still have trouble with a lot of things, my anxiety is still there telling me how life would be so much better without me in it. I started college in early February and it's going pretty good, I'm keeping up with my school work and homework, I just haven't been able to make any friends get closer with anyone yet. I see how most people have already made at least one friend and it just causes this ache in my chest, making me want to cry. I do put myself out there, I talk to my classmates, I ask them about their life and what subjects they're doing, all of that. But outside of class, i don't have anyone to sit with at lunch or anything. At my last school most people knew me and would say hello, how are you going, but past that, there was nothing.

We got so blazed we started to panic, and then had to walk home on the dark city streets. They were shouting and freaking out, I urinated myself, the cops almost pulled us over someone higher then us tried to steal a car down the road and distracted him, thank god and when we finally got home and I was alone, I tried to hang myself.

"I used to think the same! but this is where the misconception comes from, the autism spectrum isn't an autism scale. If Autism is that primary single genetic biological condition that starts causing differences in brain development within the first few months after birth, that 'thing' that is autism can cause any number of things to happen from that point. It will present with key measurable differences in perception cognition, but these can all be masked by learned behaviour. The issue is it can cause a ton of other developmental conditions that aren't exclusive to autism, for example dyslexia dyspraxia on the light side of things but also very severe effects like very low intelligence. All these possible effects and interactions create a huge web of possible presentations linked to the one diagnosis. The thing to note is that Autism itself is an illness, yes there are elements of social disability, but an autistic person who isn't disabled by co- morbidities is likely to struggle mostly because society isn't built around the autistic brain. Very extreme autistic development can cause disability though, for example over- sensitivity to basic stimuli can make living hell. There are strengths of autistic brains outside of Savant syndrome as well!

It was the only motivation I had to hold on to. I've been severely depressed the majority of this decade. Mostly because I build myself up, only to have it torn back down each time. Once- in- a- lifetime opportunities arise time after time, only for me to close the door on them long stories . However what tiny shred of hope I had left was in my dreams. Dreams of a better place, a better situation, of a possible future and outcomes, and they'd be so real. That's what kept me going. It's as if my subconscious was my personal motivator.

"You are correct in that I do not have kids, however to list out some of the things in my life I have ruined here is a short list 1. had scholarships for universities coming out of middle school and ended up completely giving up on school and dropping out, I did later get my GED at age 19, but none the less lost any chance of my full ride to college. 2. i had braces as a kid and while rebelling neglected care for them which resulted in them being removed, I now have crooked teeth, many many cavities, I need appx 7000 in dental work for cavities alone as well as corrective jaw surgery to fix my overbite, braces to fix my crooked teeth. 3. I spent age 16- 21 with what I thought would be the love of my life only to have her leave me quite obviously due to my lack of progression in life I have worked a dead end job for 4 years and have not received a single raise, I am a 1099 and neglected saving for taxes so I have a few thousand in debt for back logged taxes. 4. completely burned bridges with ex losing the one person to ever truly care about me, have constant regrets about not finding a way to get into school instead of burning my money on motorcycles and video games during our relationship, I watched her go through 3 years of college and I think her watching me do absolutely nothing ultimately ruined our relationship. 5. I have about 3000 in credit card debt, 1500 owed to my sister current only person willing to be there for me 1800 on an auto loan which was accumulated from not having gap insurance and being in an accident, 2000 in hospital bills from said accident. 4000 on my current vehicle loan. And as mentioned before about 2000 in backlogged taxes. 6. Several tickets making my insurance rather high, fleeing and eluding police at age 16, careless driving, etc. 7. I have absolutely no savings and my assets dont even come close to off setting my total debt. I feel as if I made a string of bad choices which not only caused my life to fall apart and lose the only thing I cared about my girlfriend , but I also now am struggling so hard to get back into life as I can not afford to live anywhere, and if I do pay for anything then I am trapped and can not afford to start getting rid of my debt. Therefore currently I am homeless, and even then with my current job I am projected to be in debt for a great amount of time, interest is still ticking away, I can not afford school and my parents will not help with a FASFA. I have looked for better paying jobs and while they are out there the difference it would make it almost irrelevant.

"Ill try not to make this a novel- it took 3 doctors 6 months and 3- 4 hospital visits to diagnose me with GERD. It took another 2 months to get the medication right to control it. In between those times I was flashed with warnings of cancers or other life- altering threatening diseases that I became a hypochondriac. Im a 28 male. After taking a round of antibiotics for a bug I cought I noticed I was peeing a lot more than usual. I brought it up with my doc and out come all the tests again. I was given a metabolic blood panel, two urine tests, and some blood culture tests. When those came up normal- I was given a brief prostate exam. I suppose he found something up with my prostate because he sent me home with something for prostasis. I finished the course and it nothing fixed itself so I was sent home with Flomax for shrinking of the prostate . Symptoms have gotten less severe but are still there. In the mean time Im looking up symptoms again and the worries start flowing.

"A little over a week or so ago I talked to my doctor about increasing my dosage of vyvanse because it wasn't quite lasting into the evening when I did study after school although, this current 30mg dosage still had really good effects on my mood, energy and concentration. My doctor gave me the all clear, and moved me up to 50mg. I happened to have 2 big assignments due later in the week when I started the new dose. When I went to work on them, I firstly noticed how slow my brain seemed to be going. It felt like it wasn't working properly, and felt really blank. Like on one day, I spent 6 hours non stop on the assignments but got hardly anything done, because I would hyper focus on every word I wrote and couldn't seem to string a proper sentence together. I attributed this to me just being tired, and didn't think it was the higher dose that was the problem. On the following days, I started feeling mentally exhausted, more and more to the point that I felt very depressed. At this point I was struggling to bring myself to do any work on the assignments at all and felt extremely anxious. I still didn't make the connection to the new dose, and thought it was just anxiety about the due dates that were only a few days away. Long story short, I ended up missing out on parts of one of the assignments, and had barely started the other one by the time the due dates rolled around and had to submit them that way. I felt really disappointed with myself because I was doing so well with my schoolwork up until this point. I was thinking about why I had crashed all of a sudden, so the next day I decided to take 30mg again instead of the higher dose to see if that was causing problems. The issues completely went away that day, and I felt 1000000x better, making me realize that the dose was too high and was the root of all the strange issues I was having","increased vyvanse dose from 30 mg - 50 mg , which was ended up being too high and really messed with my head .

"My parents are extremely ignorant when it comes to mental health and they completely ignored mental illness being a thing until I had the ultimate breakdown hardly a year ago. They get extremely pissed and assume things when I try to explain things to them and when I tell them to do research they don't, but they'll bitch and moan at me if I don't know something and just hound me to do my own research. They're extremely hypocritical and look at me like a freak when I explain anything to them. I recently explained to my dad how my brain worked in regards to my ED anorexia? bulimia? both??? and he got extremely mad and told me I was wasting his money and why don't I just get better already, and why don't I literally just stop y'know just stop being ill, like that's how physical illnesses work.

I went to therapy once and immediately said I never wanted to go back because I was in such a weird headspace and frankly, the woman made me uncomfortable.

"I just moved in with my boyfriend, who has his 7yo son with him every other week. His son is a very curious kid who needs constant auditory stimulation, and I'm someone with ADHD who is easily overloaded by external auditory stimuli. The kid needs to constantly make noise, whether it be repeating something, asking questions with no answers, or making all sorts of noises with his mouth or a toy. When I put a cartoon on for him, he doesn't make quite as much noise, but he asks a question every minute or two. I know I probably don't have to explain sensory overload here, but for me, too many external noises I don't have control over is akin to being pinched with fingernails every second. It's not just an annoyance the mental emotional response is similar to a pain response. Likewise, we're in a small apartment and it seems no room has been designated off limits where I can hide away and feel completely free of interruption. I'm on my second day watching him. The first day was rough, but I tried to manage. Today I didn't even last 4 hours. I was told by my boyfriend that he's fairly self- sufficient and doesn't need to be given attention every minute, and that I can just tell him to go play by himself. We did a puzzle this morning while he watched Scooby Doo, but I needed to get away for a bit and cool off. I told him I needed to go lay down. He proceeded to follow me into the bedroom, lay on the bed and stare. I started to enter panic attack mode, so I sat up and turned away to face the wall, trying to control my breathing. He returned to the bedroom with a bath toy and started constantly squeaking it right behind me. My brain entered that ""I AM IN DANGER AND NEED TO GET OUT NOW""mode. I got up, tried to look for an escape, said ""I need to go for a walk"", thought about changing out of my pajama pants and putting shoes on for about a solid second, but the DANGER WILL ROBINSON mode was too strong and instead I dashed out of the apartment in PJs and no shoes, and sat on the steps for a while, processing what just occurred by typing it on my phone. My moving in is enough of a change for him, and I don't want to force designated off- limits spots, or tell him he needs to change his personality. I know kids internalize things so I also don't want to make him feel bad or like he's wrong for just being a kid. I don't want a 7yo to feel wholly responsible for an adult's ADHD, but if I don't think I can tolerate having to deal with this every other week","Moved in with stepson who is a noisy and inquisitive kid and have already been sent into FoF from sensory overload .

"Hi everyone, I've been lurking here for a while and think I might have ADHD procrastination issues, disorganized etc. . I made a doctor's appointment but am still reading up on it which leads me to my question concerning hyperfocus. So in general, if something interests me I am able to focus intently on it read about it for hours, have 20 related tabs open etc.. but pretty regularly I find myself almost obsessed with a topic and I'm not sure if this is still hyperfocus or something else. I will become interested in a certain topic coding, photography, blogging and I will spend the next week only reading about that topic, learning everything about it, getting super excited and basically feeling like my interest in it is a revelation and I found my true calling I.e. now not only interested in photography but need to become a photographer, plan what gear I'll buy and how I'll set up my business . I am not able to think clearly during that time and everything just seems to make so much sense. Then, one day, I find myself absolutely exhausted and kind of done with it. Just like that. Finding out it was only one of my weird obsessions what was I thinking??? Is always a surprise and a huge disappointment. This really really impairs my ability to function normally as I seem to loose all reason when I'm in that state and thus don't know how to avoid change it. Question are you experiencing something like that with your adhd? Is that hyperfocus, could that be related to adhd or is this something completely different? If so, any idea what? I thought it might also be bipolar hypomania I also have recurring depression but I don't think I would meet the criteria for a true hypomanic episode. Sorry for rambling and thank you for any insight or advice!

No matter how long I live, nothing I want is going to drop out of nowhere, and I can't beat my social anxiety to get the things I want because I'm a pussy and I prefer not to risk. Last week I took a social anxiety test and got all of the issues and none strengths. I feel like a fucking kid and I'm 17 years old. I don't have any form of social life and everyone laughs at me for that.

"Hi all, I've searched through this sub to see if anyone else has this problem but wanted to see if I can get anymore feedback or similar situations. I'm 29F and was first diagnosed with depression at 15, anxiety at 24, and ADHD at 29. Over the past few years I've lost over 45 pounds, workout 4 days a week, have a healthy diet 75 I'd say , etc. However, I cannot for the life of me get my blood pressure or heart rate down to a ""normal rate"". My husband for example is a bit overweight and his resting heart rate is only about 65. Mine is MAYBE 85, but during the day I'm typically sitting between 95- 115 bpm. My blood pressure is high when I go to the doctors office but I also know part of that is just panic every time I have to go in. I know cardio can be helpful in trying to help with heart rates but that is kind of my last resort because I hate it so much much prefer lifting, pilates, yoga, and sports . I've started to dig in and wonder if this is all mental that is causing this problem. I have a tendency to not deal with emotions so instead of thinking about it my body has taken on the extra stress. My back is full of knots, of I have TMJ from clenching my jaw, and now I'm wondering if the heart rate is my body just dealing with stress. I stress because I feel that my life is an endless list of to do items that will never ever get completed and I just keep disappointing myself. If I think about it too much, then the anxiety really kicks in. Does anyone else struggle from this? Some of my doctors just don't get concerned because everything else about me is seemingly healthy. BMI is only 21, blood work comes back good, I'm young and active, but in the back of my head something keeps telling me that this is going to be a huge problem down the road if I don't get to the root of the issue now. Anyway, thanks for letting me rant and I'd love to get people's feedback or similar stories or recommendations for things that have helped them!

"It almost happened on the way to work today. There is a stretch of road that is two lanes, which eventually merge into one where the right lane ends. Some people, including myself, use the right lane to bypass most of the traffic in the left lane since traffic is heavier in the left lane. I had my signal on and was getting ready to merge. My eyes were on the left lane as I watched for a space to merge. This guy in the left lane was at a frustratingly awkward position and wouldn't reduce increase speed. Finally I was able to merge. However, I narrowly missed a collision with one of those huge trucks that transports dozens of cars to car dealerships. It was sitting stationary in the right lane trying to make a left- hand turn into a car dealership I presume he was sitting in the right lane so he could make a wide left . I didn't even SEE him sitting there because I was watching the left lane, assuming that all traffic in front of me was moving forward. There's no option to make a right hand turn, so all right lane traffic normally just travels forward there'd be no reason for someone to be stopped in the right lane. Of all of the times I've made my morning commute, this was the first time that a situation like that had occurred. I wouldn't have even seen it coming. I was going 40 mph and he was sitting still and I surely would've just smashed right into the back of him and my little '08 Focus would've crumpled up like a tin can.

"Echoing the sentiment of others - but get a 2nd opinion! Preferably from someone who specialises in adult ADHD. For me, I sailed through school because the work wasn't challenging, school has lots of structure and I'm a brilliant bullshit artist. The trouble started when I was at uni - all of a sudden I had a lot more freedom, but I played lots of sports, overcommitted myself and slipped into the ""I'm just here to party and have a good uni experience""lifestyle - which is rewarded! My grades were mediocre at best, but I was having _fun_ and I was _carefree_! Then I spent several years working various cushy office jobs where I was overpaid, underworked and micromanaged which was fine by me - it meant I could autopilot my way along but never felt any sense of achievement or fulfillment. My wake up call came when I turned 30 and I got headhunted for what looked like an amazing job. Long story short, I lasted less than 2 months because I couldn't concentrate or focus, I forgot things, lost things, couldn't get things done on time and my colleagues were super impatient and mean . I did a lot of soul searching after I left and fortunately landed a new job that is actually pretty great - however the work is largely self directed and I was struggling - even though the work isn't hard and my boss is thrilled with me, I know deep down I'm working about 10 of what I'm capable of. My other wake up call was observing my boyfriend - who is highly successful with a great job and was a national level athlete. And yes, while some of it is talent, I see how he puts hours and hours into learning new programming languages, researching for his training and other personal projects - and I just can't do that - even if I want to! I think about all the things I could achieve if I could focus for even one hour a day! My doctor and psychiatrist asked me a lot about what a diagnosis would mean for my life - it will mean I can do the master's degree I've been putting off, I can work effectively without direction which is critical if you ever want to progress your career beyond gopher level , I won't spend hours on Reddit when I can be doing a project I want my goal is to learn University level maths .

"I don't know what to do anymore. This is going to be a long post and I apologize in advance but I'm desperate for any input at this point. Just some preliminary information I'm a 20 year old guy. I am currently seeing a therapist covered by insurance that helps me with certain issues that being gender, and she provides certain referrals I need for future surgeries and treatment, which is the only reason I still visit her but I tried talking about my anxiety the other day, and she absolutely doesn't help me with that. I already am currently looking for a new therapist, too. As much as I try, I never stop overthinking. I feel like by noon I have no energy left anymore because I spend all of my time overthinking from the second I wake up, to the second I go to bed. Even if I know that my worries might be totally irrational. I can't control it and I feel like ripping my hair out at this point. I communicated to my therapist that I keep overthinking and spiraling and I can't stop it, but it doesn't work. The only thing she said over and over, phrased differently? ""Just don't let your anxiety get to you and stop pressuring yourself.""How am I supposed to stop doing that? It's not like this is all just emotional. It shows physically.

Of course a move is stressful for a cat, but I tried my very best to make it all as comfortable as possible for him. He's settling in quite well, but for some reason I'm still constantly worried. Worried about leaving him too long because I am now the only person living in my apartment even though we left my cat alone for 8- 10 hours a day for years, worried that he's not happy for some reason, worried that I fucked up and should have left him at my dad's but if I did that, I would be worried about him not taking proper care of him and my cat being unhappy because he misses me ","I would be worried either way . In my head I 'm constantly thinking that I should be doing more , I 'm not doing enough or I 'm doing something wrong .

"So basically I'm a ""team member""at a pet store, meaning my job is supposed to vary between everything we have, cashing, stocking, animal care etc. But for a long time now since I got hired I've been shoved to the front to cash mainly because nobody else wants to. I've suffered through it for now but on Sunday I got written up for leaving the register and not calling people for backup when I have a line, as well as not being ""happy enough"". With my adhd spd it's getting difficult for me to be a cashier constantly and not being able to move around. I thrive on the sales floor, I love facing things and problem solving our customers issues. But I'm always stuck at the front in the same routine, and it's very sensory lacking for me, so I often wander off to straighten the front or chat with people near the front when nobody's cashing out. I don't want to get fired, and I'm not sure where to go about this. I really do try to be my happiest, but with severe depression I don't know how they want me to act happier.

"I'd like to start by saying I'm not the greatest at telling stories, so this is likely jumbled up pretty badly. I need advice and to be convinced out of this path I'm going down, I hope this is the right place for that I've been in depression since I was 12 years old, I am 15 now, pretty healthy, decent looking, and appear to be a perfectly normal quiet kid that minds his own business. I don't normally toot my own horn, but I am a pretty smart person, consider myself to know more about the world as it is today than most adults do, but know that I am not wiser than many who are older. Skip to the final paragraph now if my bullshit rambling is too long to read. My relationship with my parents has never been bad, for as long as I can remember they have been very good to me, I've lived in the middle class my whole life and my parents make around 80k a year combined, more than enough to provide for three children, including myself. I am the oldest child in my family, and I cannot stress enough that my family is a very healthy one. Like I said, since I was 12 I have suffered from depression, only before this year I had no idea what it was. I was very dark, and still am, I have dark thoughts, I've had dark nightmares, but I keep it all to myself. It was almost like the depression stayed in this corner of my mind, and my physical self stayed in this corner, the darkness never showed itself, and I appeared healthy and happy. As stupid as this next bit may seem, I like to compare myself to Dexter Morgan, from the TV series Dexter, I was also very dark, had little to no emotions or feelings, everything that the fictional character is except the whole serial killer part. Now to get to everything that has caused me pain. A girl. Call me naive, call me immature, call me whatever you want to, but I grew to love this girl more than anything in existence, without a doubt. She is the only thing I love, and we were excellent friends, and it was only a matter of time before we got together. She was the greatest thing to ever enter my life, I can say this with complete honesty, and the summer I spent with her was the happiest I had ever been in my 15 years. We talked nonstop, day and night, I'd get little to no sleep for days and days just talking to her. I was in love, and I knew it. She had left another kid to be with me, she was in a dead relationship and she wanted out anyways, I was just that push to finally do it. She came to me and wanted nothing to do with him. Reddit, I was planning to spend the rest of my life with this girl, I love her, but like I said, I probably seem naive and immature for believing so, but I didn't come here to be judged because I'm 15 and ""just a kid, ""or to be told that I'm ""too young to know what love is.""Fast forward to the beginning of school. Appearently the kid tells the girl I'd give my life to protect that he is going to get together with this other girl and get this she gets jealous and very soon, she leaves me. There's a lot more to that portion of the story, but I could honestly fill a fucking novel with the shit I've been put through. Reddit, I've been crushed so many times that I lost count. I've kept her as my best friend since we broke up and she has told me she needs me, except she has also told me she doesnt have feelings for me, all this bullshit. I dont want to get too into it though. She has made me into someone horrible. Someone that has cut scars into his skin that will never go away. She knows this too, I've made it very clear. She knows I'm suicidal, and get this, her boyfriend emotionally abuses her day in, day out, telling her that he likes this other girl too and he ignores her there's so much that goes into this, I can't even begin to explain","the girl I love has crushed me so many times that I have become severely suicidal , I 'm sitting in my basement bedroom right now and I have a noose tied into the rafters .

"Hi guys, I am a 23 y o dude and I have recently self- diagnosed myself with OCD. I am seeing a therapist and we talk about these things, but I was seeking different opinions on what's going on with me lately. I've been kind of experiencing relationship OCD with my gf for a while now. We recently got back together after I ruined our relationship by cheating, which I believe was also fueled by my OCD. We've made much progress in the 3 months since we started back together but there's been many speedbumps such as cheating OCD and such. However, I've been experiencing this specific thought and obsession lately I feel so guilty for ruining us that I've been confessing every little minor thing I did with other women during the time we were apart i.e. texting, nudes I had of others, interactions w the women I had sex with . When I have nothing left to confess, I start searching my memory for more to confess. She understandably gets mad when I confess these things, but it's mostly because she doesn't want me to tell her about anything unless its another instance of me having sex with someone during our time apart which I've already told her all about . I feel so undeserving all the time and I believe this is what it stems from my guilt. The worst part is that I feel like every little bad thing I did matters so that's why I haven't stopped myself. Even after she tells me these things don't matter and that she'd rather not hear about it. Is this a specific form of OCD? I know about scrupulosity but that's more religious.

"Hi everyone, Im very rigid about plans and I hate when things dont play out the way I want them to. I know this is a problem, and Ive been working on it. Ive been getting better at going with the flow and rearranging my schedule. My boyfriend has a lot of hang ups about cleaning so I have to wake up in the middle of the night a lot to help him. I try to do exercises every other day in the morning, but I also have to do chores, shopping, and cleaning so Ive been good about juggling my workouts with my boyfriends needs. amp About a month ago I started using an app to micro- journal and keep track of my moods. It helps a lot to see patterns. I also act better because I want to be able to write good things in the journal without lying. Yesterday I was doing great. I unexpectedly had the day off. I followed all of my boyfriends cleaning rules. I helped him. When he wanted food I went out shopping for him. Didnt get angry, didnt spiral, etc. Then in the evening he woke up, and came in angry at me because he believed he heard me go lock the frint door I was sitting browsing my tablet the whole time I was calm, and used coping skills to talk it out with him. But he kept coming back and accusing me, saying he couldnt believe me because Im a liar and Ive lied in the past. I was calm for a while but finally I just flew off the handle. Besides the obvious of him not believing me, what bothered me the most was 1. Even when I do everything Im supposed to, he still gets angry. Nothing is good enough. Im still bad. 2. I finally had a perfect day and he ruined it by lying and blaming me. I was yelling and screaming at the top of my lungs in anger and frustration. Then this morning he woke me up at 5am. The process started again and I ended up screaming, yelling, and being physically violent. amp Lately Ive really been struggling black and white thinking. Everythings bad. Everything I do is bad. Im bad. Why arent you happy? I never do anything right. etc. Then the only way I can get out of it is switching to a bitchy personality never turns out well or just telling myself Its okay. Everything is okay. Its alright. Its going to be good. Over and over again and just putting on a happy face and doing whatever my boyfriend wants. amp","I need coping skills methods for inflexibility and black and white thinking .

"About a week ago, things had gotten pretty bad between us. My anxiety and depression were bad because of school stress among other things.

"I work in a kitchen as an intern, this is my third week. my first two weeks were wonderful and everyone was really nice. My chef was suspiciously cold towards me in the beginning only giving me orders not looking me in the eye or having any conversations with me that I can participate in but i thought nothing of it. I need to complete a 6 week internship program in order to get my diploma that I paid 30, 000 dollars for. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of for my labor when I walk through those doors but still i walk on because of the pressure of debt. this diploma doesn't ensure you have a higher chance of getting a job in the slightest but it cost me a lot of money pain and suffering to get this far and I wasn't going to stop just short.

I work as cleanly and tightly as possible and always am respectful of the chef. last week when the kitchen crew just got back to work from lunch and I was starting a project I put away before we broke for lunch. during lunch I was speaking to one of my coworkers whom is the only person other than myself who speaks enough English to carry on a conversation and just so happened to be also female. we carried on calmly doing our work while chatting to keep our minds busy. suddenly my chef male quietly walked up behind me and screams at the top of his lungs something along the lines of this 'TWO WOMEN IN THE KITCHEN WHO CANT KEEP THEIR FUCKING MOUTHS SHUT, DO I HAVE TO SEPARATE YOU TWO OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO GET SOME FUCKING WORK DONE AROUND HERE? we were not behind on our work in the slightest.

"As a long- term sufferer of anxiety and depression, I'm no stranger to related nightmares. But the dream that I had during my post Christmas meal nap takes some beating. In my dream, I was sobbing my heart out after my wife's death. The dream never made clear how my wife died she is, thankfully, alive and well in real life . I'd be wandering around town at night, crying and drinking myself into oblivion. I'd even attempt to break into closed pubs and shops to steal more booze I rarely drink alcohol . I wouldn't be able to face returning to an empty home, so I'd darken my parents' doorstep at some ungodly hour. From there, I'd continue sobbing on the sofa in their living room, while my mum would try in vain to calm me down. ""You're very depressed, ""my mum would say in deeply sombre tones. My mum was never much of a consolatory type, often leaving it to my dad to comfort me when I was upset as a child. She has also very rarely even acknowledged my mental health problems. Thus, those few words and attempts to console me really do stand out. I would try to ask my mum how my dad and my cats were, but simply couldn't speak through my sobs. I'd think about making sure that my cats would go to a good home before I took my own life. I've never felt so bereft of hope and will to live, nor had such a cold, bleak view of the world, as in that dream.

"I know being chronically late is a symptom, but I've always found myself arriving early on many occasions. The reason for this is because I'm always stressing to myself that I have an appointment, hangout, interview at a certain time, and I become so anxious about it. I can't stand just sitting in my desk at home trying to study because the idea of this excuse to leave wont leave my mind. I decide to drive off so I can leave behind what I am doing now and on many occasions I've been 30 minutes early. It's not such a great thing, however, because now I have to wait to be called in, wait for my friends to get ready, etc. I really hate the feeling of being late because I used to do it before, and although that may seem like a good thing, it still causes its own problems. Because I arrive so early now, I'm usually sitting in my car, in a chair bored and fidgety. I guess what I'm saying is I have to pick between the 2 - arrive late and stress intensely during the whole process of getting somewhere - arrive early and not have to stress about the time constraint, but sit around waiting bored as hell I choose the second option because, although I hate waiting, I don't let people down this way.

I normally try and help out a department to avoid doing a tour but this time I wasnt able to. Naturally I was terrified in the morning as my small talk skills are non existent and my social skills in general are severely lacking.

"I guess I will start this off wit a bit of back story I am in high school and male. I have been going through what I think is depression and have been cutting on and off since I was 11. I have somehow become friends with the most amazing girl she is in collage I have ever known and we literally tell each other everything, we obviously are not romantically or sexually active with each other save for a bit of fooling around to see how many necks snap in public . So my problem is that I have told her about my self injury and cutting, she is really upset that I do that and has asked me many times why? unfortunately at this time I dont exactly know why I do it or why I am depressed. I try to keep her from knowing about it as much as possible so I will not upset her. Last night we where hanging out with some of our friends about to go to star bucks, i keep my razor in my wallet in the folds of a small star bucks coupon she knew that . I needed to take out my wallet and get the coupon so I told my friends and her that I would be right back so I started walking up the street and fiddling with my wallet so I could get the coupon without them seeing my razor. She wasnt too happy about what I was doing and demanded that I let her come with me she then made me give her the razor after she loudly and playfully snatched my wallet. I understood that she was just trying to protect me, later that night I admitted to her that I had been cutting and not telling her and that I was hurt that she took my razor.

"Hey everyone, Ill start off by saying I am undiagnosed and I medicated, but currently seeing a psychiatrist. Ive always felt like I might have had adhd in highschool, but I was also told my whole life that Im lazy and dont apply myself. So between that, and the stigma of being medicated, and the fact that i honestly didnt really give a shit about school got Bs and Cs by doing absolutely bare minimum. Same in college.

"I've been in my new job for about 1.5 months now and I can already tell I'm messing up. I've gotten looks that tell me I've just said something stupid. I swear I'm saying things in the same vein that the other people in a conversation are doing, but I get ""the look""anyway. Folks have already stopped really interacting with me or even saying hello. I guess they were nice at first just due to curiosity, but now that the new has worn off My job is also requiring I shift gears fastand make large changes in a processes with no notice at all. Furthermore, there's a public presentation component that wasn't in the job description at all. Thankfully, it's behind the scenes, but even with that, there may end up being changes to a presentation while the presenter is talking. There's backstage whispered emergency conversations everywhere and the presentation is live . I shadowed the last session so I could watch, but with all the noise, music was too loud and so many conversations, I totally short circuited. It was all I could do to not run out of there. My boss also sort of got on to me today because I spent too much time on a project. I started building the code to pull a population list, then I started on the html email only to find out that my predecessor had been using an external style sheet and yahoo and gmail weren't rendering it at all. I fought with style sheet formatting for a while before I found that out. Then I tried inline style info only to find out that my mass email program stripped that out of my code before sending out an email. So I finally went totally old school and built nested tables and used deprecated code that my proprietary management system could understand. Apparently my boss thought I should have been able to do all this in 30 minutes or so. It took me most of a day because I'm new to the database management tool, new to html email, and I tried to do things the way my predecessor did. I'm not a coding guru and I'm not paid to be a guru. So why am I expected to work so fast? And why is it better that the person before me banged something out fast but it didn't work ? I totally don't understand why my bosses seem like they'd rather have something done wrong and quickly versus done right. Anyway, my last job got real uncomfortable and I finally had to leave because I was being overtly shunned and ostracized. I still have no idea what I did that was so bad.

"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. One of my college friend groups consists of a few friends I'll refer to 5 of them as A, B, C, D, E , of which A is clinically depressed. I must mention that she doesn't seek help because her parents don't believe in it and she feels like it wouldn't help. The friend group started off normal enough, with us playing league every so often, studying before exams, going out to eat. A and B were in a relationship, as were C and D, and E and myself. Recently, A and B broke up and in the beginning B was fine with everyone still hanging out like normal, albeit feeling a bit hurt. But things got sticky when it's been revealed that A had feelings for BOTH C and D the entire time she was in the relationship. During her depressive states, she constantly goes to either of them, and at times got a bit too close for everyone's comfort, including C and D. Upon finding out that she liked other people throughout her relationship, B became even more upset and started to distance himself away from everyone. Meanwhile, C and D have been trying to discuss what to do, and each mutually agreed that whenever A got too close to either one of them, the other would feel uncomfortable but both of them still cared for her very much. Both of them would try and gently reject her advances, but A would still constantly ignore the rest of the friend group if either of the two were in the room, and even getting a bit too touchy with them when we're all huddled up around the TV for movie night. One of A's issues is that she becomes very emotionally dependent on people she grows close with, and essentially only feels motivation if other people are around her to encourage her to do things. On her own, she often sleeps in her room and leaves only to eat or occasionally attend classes just enough so that she doesn't fail. I and E offered to step in a bit more often to try and distract her from the others, and to encourage her from finding other hobbies or going to classes . This has not resulted well on E's side, as he would try and bring her material from class and give her a crash course, but her individual performance in the course has not improved at all. He's getting very tired of her copying his notes and homework, even though he says that he's understanding that depression blocks motivation quite often. I pointed out one day that while it's great that we share a few of the same classes, she can't rely on others all the time come exam season, and perhaps it would be best to withdraw from a few classes so she can take small steps back into being a full- time student instead of overburdening herself. She kind of shut down afterwards, claiming that she was tired and napped throughout the rest of the day, which made me feel absolutely terrible. I know that for those with depression, friends are absolutely crucial as day- to- day support, a source of motivation, something to distract from the bad thoughts even if temporary. But for my friend, I and the others are now at a loss of what we can do after this mess. I'm afraid of what she might do to herself after her friends distance themselves away from her. We all really want to help her, but currently we're at a loss of what to do. Please help","Friend group , depressed friend broke up with one of our friends who has been distancing himself from her .

"ThIs my first post here, and I'm feeling lost and sick and tired. I have depression. For the longest time I told myself I was Just an introvert, just shy, just a bit awkward, just sensitive, but four years ago I broke down and went to my universities psych department.

"Hello. Writing this from a park bench quickly on my lunch break. My first thought when I woke up this morning was how not existing for the last 8 hours was. I'm lucky to have a job, but I can't pull myself away from the fact I lost my previous jobs due to preformace issues. And it's not just that one - it's pretty much all the jobs I've had.

"Sorry for the long post. Let me know if another subreddit is more appropriate or could give other useful advice. My brother has been fucking up for the last couple of years. This first happened a couple years ago. He stalked some girl he met to another state a 5 or 6 mile drive away. He then hung around the house trying to see her. This came after he fb messaged her thousands of times in a one- way conversation. He was lucky that he was a minor and got it expunged with some probation and community service. The second time happened when he went away for college. He appeared to be doing fine, when he again got in trouble for stalking a girl. He had mandatory therapist sessions that he had to complete for a year. At the time, they seemed only a little helpful. Looking back, they didn't help at all. My parents forced him to stay home after that and attend the local college. About a year ago, he stole a lot of money from my dad. This was happening for months before my dad realized. A couple months after that, he convinced my dad to buy a car saying he had a lot of money saved up. This was a lie, and I don't think my dad has seen any of the money. Fast- forward a couple months, and he tries to commit suicide in the garage by running his car with the door down. He got rushed to the hospital. He clearly told us it was a suicide attempt, but he recanted when he later spoke with a hospital psychiatrist. I'm not sure what's true and what's not. He did this because the old car that my dad and brother bought was a POS that got hit and they didn't do any research . So, he wanted a new car. My dad ended up buying a used sports car with the promise he pay it back. Towards the end of last year, my brother drove my dad to the airport. My dad lectured him about his behavior, which led my brother to drive erratically. I'm unclear if he had any intent to hurt my dad. My brother says he was always in control of the car. Most recently, he decided he wanted to buy a gun and commit suicide. He stole some checks and forged the signature to transfer a couple grand out. He then tells us he tried to check into a local mental health facility very early in the morning without any luck. He then bought a ticket to leave town for a couple of days. The scary part about the most recent incident is I don't think anything bad would turn up on his background check if he actually followed through. With all the gun violence recently and his history of mental stability, I'm also worried if he has any other ideas. The thing with the suicide is we're unsure if he's actually suicidal or just very, very manipulative. I think it's real due to low self- worth. I take parts of the stories with a grain of salt. He is a compulsive liar, so I don't trust a lot of what he tells me. My parents are also terrible at communicating, so I don't fully trust their stories either. I've talked about putting him in some full time mental health center. My parents are fully behind this. Cost isn't a huge deal given how much we've paid in lawyer fees, stolen money, and stress. The problem is that there aren't really many around, and the ones that are have turned him away sometimes according to him and sometimes my dad . It's frustrating getting turned away at every point. I've also discussed just pressing charges and let him experience the real world, but my parents are worried about him turning to drugs and crime. This even comes up when I suggest that he move out and they cut off support. I realize they're enabling him, but I don't know how to convince them to kick him out. This has been happening more and more frequently. He seems normal according to what therapists say, just very selfish. He has moments of clarity and self- reflection where he talks to us, but he just does it again in another months. I'd like to help as my parents are ineffective, but I live really far away","brother stalks girls and is emotionally manipulative with family , lying frequently and stealing multiple times . he says he 's tried to commit suicide twice , maybe more . parents are useless .

"Before it was discovered I had ADHD- PI in college it probably would have been discovered in middle school or high school had it not been for my circumstances and I had very difficult circumstances that depressed me. struggled getting my assignments done, focusing in class, couldn't stop zoning out and day dreaming , reading was hell, my working memory was always bad, and my parents ended up staying till 3am doing my work for me. On top of that my parents used to spend thousands of dollars on tutors to try and help me, and these tutors usually just got really pissed at me because I couldn't follow their directions well, it was hard for me to do things at their pace, or do the stuff they assigned me. Teachers did kind of notice that things didn't match up between the work I ""supposedly produced""and the way I was in class and sent home notes to my parents, but my parents always met with them and insisted that the work was mine and told the teachers all these supposedly great things i've done, which were my parents work. Students, however bullied me a lot because they picked up the incosistancies as well. My parents even took me out of regular school and home- schooled me for a few years because of this. I used to think everyone struggled like I did. In high school I ended up struggling even more having to cheat in ridiculous ways to be able to succeed and it made me feel terrible. I always tried to keep up with the work, focus, memorize, but it never worked out so thats what happened. Of course I got caught a ton, but teachers still let me go because they saw how guilty and bad i felt and they liked my personality. Also, my parents called them. I also ended up spent 4 years at the community college because i was so lost and couldn't balance my schedule, show up on time, turn in assignments and I kept changing my major because everything seemed interesting and then I'd get into classes, struggle with my same focusing issues and have to drop out. Eventually it was discovered what was going on with me and now i'm doing a lot better with treatment, but this is my past. All of those misrepresentations from my parens and facades fell apart. It makes me so anxiety- ridden to even discuss it and I grew up very guilty and sad because of this stuff. Sometimes I'm angry at my parents for not noticing or understanding, but they really wanted to help me in the best way they could at the time even though they didn't understand either. I also feel bad that they had to take on my responsibilities no matter how hard i tried on my own and it always felt so so wrong and I hated cheating and just going into exams completely lost because I didn't understand anything no matter how hard I tried to study and I really wanted to learn so badly. My parents also gave me a lot of opportunities growing up that a lot of people don't have and because of who I am I was unable to take utilize them. They wanted me to play the piano, paint, and numerous other things, which I just couldn't do or balance focus on. I really feel like i grew up letting everybody down because of who I am. It also feels really shitty having to had to struggle so much when now things are way more manageable for me. Right now I'm graduating college and I feel so fucking weird about things like being able to just make it through a class, balance responsibilities, and even goof around with friends and just make people laugh. I sometimes use my past to push myself harder to achieve these days, but when it isn't troubling me like it is now I try and use it as a way of understanding that there is a lot more to each person and their circumstances than meets the eye and that I want to help people and understand their circumstances as well. Still my past makes me feel incredibly guilty and bad. I want to do things the way everyone else does even if it's not fair to me, like last week when I finally talked to a professor because I need extra times on exams I just felt so bad, awkward, and stupid and vulnerable. Does anyone else have a difficult past like this?

"I 32F recently had my heart broken by a guy I fell in love with, who was also a close friend. One of our friends, who is very manipulative and angry as a person, turned everyone against me by making up lies about me. I once trusted and confided things to her when I was vulnerable. The guy I fell for kind of messed me around for a long time, telling me that he was breaking up with or had broken up with his girlfriend. But he seemed too cowardly to actually do it properly, though he said he loves me and doesn't want to be with her. I cut all ties with these people and parting with him was devastating.

"I've been ""depressed""since I was like 12 years old maybe. I've never wanted to accept it, always tried to write it off as a phase or something. Only recently have I started to realize that a ""phase""of depression wasn't just because I was an angst ridden teenager, this kind of thing shouldn't stick around for 8 years. It honestly comes and goes in bouts and often, as terribly sad as it is, it depends on my relationship with girls. If there's a girl I like a lot and things are going well, I'm beaming and ecstatic. My life becomes uplifted. Unfortunately, I've screwed it up with every girl ever, so I always hit a patch of depression for months and months afterwards until another girl comes along. Even if it's not the ending of a ""relationship""and she doesn't text me back or something stupid like that, I can hit a deep phase of depression where I'll literally have physical and mental breakdowns. The physical part is honestly strange and something I've never seen or heard of. My muscles just tense up weirdly and my body does things that I don't want it to do. It's scary and weird and overly ridiculous. Anyways, not a single person in my life knows about this. Mainly because I think if I told someone, it'd come across as too desperate for attention or whatever. I carry myself as such a happy, confident, strong individual, and that's all people see. They don't know about my depression or my social anxiety, or the fact that I will get hung up on a girl and think about her literally every waking minute, which just makes everything that much worse. And I don't want people to know, I feel like people look up to me and the outlook on life that they perceive I have I really think I want to get treated and then hopefully just stay on the medication during my deep ruts and try to stay off of it otherwise. Thing is, I'm still on my parents' insurance, so they'd obviously have to know about it before I went in. It's not that I don't want to admit it to them, but I just really don't want people to know about it. And I dunno if this is relevant or not, but my mother is bipolar and an alcoholic, and I really don't like her as a person. I've always thought that maybe this is the underlying reason to my troubles, but I don't even live at home anymore now that I'm in school. I know this was super lengthy and definitely not as bad as some people on here, but I just want some sort of advice or reassurance or something","Depressed , but all of my family friends think I 'm the happiest , most optimistic guy ever .

"I know the title may seem over the top, but I really feel, ""addicted""to weed. Around this time 3 years ago, I started smoking with my buddies in high school. It was our junior summer going into senior year, we had all the time in the world and awesome places around our hometown to explore. As the summer went on, it was just everyday constant. We didn't think anything of it, we were of course just teenagers. I told myself I was gonna stop smoking once the school year started. What a joke that turned out to be. I made the whole first week and then Friday came around and back we were on rotation right after school. I only stopped for maybe 2 weeks when I was talking to this girl a little, things just fizzled so I hopped back on. Didn't stop smoking the whole year. I even faked my drug test for the job I applied to. 3 years have gone by and I have slight favorable memories between senior year and up to know. I actually got the chance to move to California. I'm an only child so its just me, my father, and mother. I kept smoking until the day I left. Because we lived on the east coast, my dad and I drove a moving truck and our 96' bronco with a trailer behind it across country. I drove the bronco, been in my family for a long time, and it was an awesome adventure seeing the united states. I was sober, on a new adventure off to do new things. The 4 months my dad and I were living at my uncles condo until our house was finished being built. I was clear headed, night sweating the THC out omg its terrible and ready for a new life. I got a job at best buy the first week I was out there, and really focused on doing a good job. I felt motivated, ready to start school back up at the start of the year because I took a semester off moving out here.and yet, here I am writing this as ive taken 2 different hits today already. Ive fallen back into my deep pit of rotation. amp As I settled into my life here, computer back up and running, doing school work again , and having a little bit of trouble making new friends, weed helps with a lot of it. I find people I connect best to are stoners, girls, and people with past experiences. Weed not only helps start a mutual connection, I helped a kid in my math class who had broken his foot the morning of as an EMT - he did a backflip and fucked his leg up lol - to a doctor to get it xrayed. He also happened to smoke weed and so we got along. The friends I have at work all smoke as well. but it helps with the other downfalls in life as well. Loneliness. Im not saying I haven't made any memories or experiences here, I went to EDC this year and had a blast - Tripped for my 4th time on L at EDC. Its been a blessing to move out here, I just feel as someone who just turned 20 years old, I should be more productive in my everyday life. I want to embrace my hobbies of motorcycles or video games or other things I have not found yet in my life that I should have already. amp I've been smoking atleast once a day for the past 5 months, and I don't want to stop.

"My uncle has recently opened up about how severe my aunts mental illness has become.

"Hey, guys, I'm posting here because I'm a bit worried about my roommate. I dunno if this is the right place for it, but if it isn't, I'll delete this and post it elsewhere. Okay, so, to start, he works on an oil field site, so he's gone every two weeks, then back for another two weeks, and so on and so on. Well, he's been back for about a week and a half or so, and the entire time he's been drunk. There's various kinds of alcohol bottles and cans all over the living room and kitchen, and they just keep adding up whenever he's here. IF he's here. What I mean is, for the last week or so, he's been disappearing for hours at a time, mostly over- night, and I have no idea where he goes. Today, he just got back from being gone for over 27 hours, and was only here for ten minutes before he left again. I have no idea where he goes, and hey, maybe he's back with his girlfriend and goes to visit her, which is none of my business, and that's plenty fine, but I'm worried that when he leaves, he goes out drunk. I also have a feeling that maybe he does this on purpose? I'm not sure. I think he might be very depressed, or at least on his way to being depressed. When I first met him a few months ago, he seemed pretty happy and fairly chill, and other than a few bragging bottles up on his fridge, I never really would've taken him for much of a drinker. But now, this last week and a half - and the previous two weeks he was here- , he's been much more bummed out, tired, negative, a bit angry, and just really, really sad. When I've been able to talk to him, he says stuff like ""I've been better""to ""Hahaaa, I really hate myself.."", and I don't really know what to say to him. I'm having my own problems with depression and I've had many suicidal thoughts of my own, so I don't know if I'm being.. paranoid, I guess, and just over- thinking it, or if I should genuinely be worried?

"I hear you, OP. I havent looked into Barkley much but I remember his stance on medication or something rubbed me the wrong way and I disagreed with it. Ill have to look into him further. However, just because hes paid by pharmaceutical companies doesnt mean what he says is invalid. This big pharma conspiracy, like many conspiracy theories, assumes that so many people are willing to act in such an evil way and ruin peoples lives just for money. Its easy to apply this logic to faceless corporations and things like that, but think of your friends, neighbours, family, colleagues, etc. Of all the people youve actually met, how many do you think would willingly join a conspiracy like that and actively take part in it and suppress the truth?

"it's funny, i used to desire the feeling of running towards something else. the idea of running towards something new helped me get through years of depression during my teens and early 20s. i experienced a lot of less- than- kind treatment from people. i experienced family dysfunction. i didn't know how i'd make it through another day there were many times where i was DEEPLY depressed . now that i'm better, it makes me sad to know this. i'm beyond thankful that i stuck around. but for years, i told myself that developing strong friendships didn't matter to me because i figured, i would be leaving everyone and everything and i mean everything behind ""soon.""i wouldn't let others get close to me. i didn't see the point in getting close to others because i had been hurt far too many times. i became this depressed and very anxious person. i was also diagnosed with a pretty heavy case of dissociation, so i wasn't in a good place during my college years. i told myself that it was better being alone. that once i moved elsewhere, then i could meet new people, people that would understand me a gay middle eastern and start fresh. but now, i understand the importance of friendships. i miss lost friendships. i miss friendships that could have been, but will never be. i regret saying or doing certain things. i regret not doing enough to show that i cared. i regret drifting. i was too scared to show that i cared about others, people picked up on this and as a result, they left. one person, let's call them ""a""in particular told one of my friends ""b""that relationships with me were too one- sided, that people never felt like i cared, that i was too focused on myself, that i wasn't friendly, etc ""a""even tried warning me about this, but i didn't see it at the time. i only see it now. now that i'm in a better place, but no friends to get to know or hang out with. no friends except for the rare few that decided to stick by my side, although they live in my college 'city' now. and it's only now that i understand the way that i was during college. i was difficult to be around because i was depressed. people tried helping me, they listened to me, they were kind and empathetic, and yet i still left because i was so ashamed. i did things like delete these people from facebook, disappear, and never reach out to them again. or do other strange things like confide too much, seek re- assurance all the time, act too needy clingy, etc.. these individuals never reached out either. granted, it takes two people to make any relationship work, but it's only in hindsight that i realize how much i pushed others away either from acting too intense or not showing that i cared enough . many left because they couldn't deal with the one- sided relationship. i became this overly anxious person. someone that didn't know how to cultivate or keep most friendships except for a rare few . i would constantly need re- assurance. i wasn't a solid friend. my time alone has taught me the importance of friendship and how to develop friendship","to this day , this is one of my biggest regrets . i thought running away from everyone and everything was my only way out . i was ashamed of my past . i have burnt far too many bridges to count . i missed out on getting to know so many great people . it truly is one of my biggest regrets . today , i stand on my own and it 's such a shitty feeling . that 's where the saying ""hindsight is 20 20 ""and ""if i knew then , what i know now ""come into play . the reality is , that ""things change , friends leave , and nobody stops for anybody .

"Yesterday i had to go to the grocery store and i reminded myself to take a key with me. I swear to god that I put those keys in my pocket. My own keys have about 50 soda can tabs on them so I can find them easier, but they didn't fit in a specific pair of pants with tight pockets. That's why I made the concious decision to take a smaller pair with me. I remember holding the keys in my hand. But, as you might have guessed when i returned home, no keys and a locked door.

"It's a process, and I'm venting a bit.. I've never been a guy that's been confident in my abilities because for years I've been put down. I was bullied in 8th grade name calling, physical contact. That didn't bother me, I stood up for myself and that was all. Even after that, I was always doubted. Work ethic when playing hockey because I was small growing up, baseball because I didn't immediately have the physical strength to be a good hitter, basketball because I was small. Fast forward 8- 9 years, and I feel like I have nothing going for me. I no sooner get a positive, and a bunch of negatives follow. I signed up for online dating in January, and in March I met what was a great girl. We hit it off right away, and we eventually decided to meet up a week and a half or so after we started talking, we went on a few dates, and before you know it she was my girlfriend. I finally fought threw my social anxiety and got myself a girlfriend for the first time in close to seven years. We got along great, we fell in love which is considered a little quickly, but things were great. We spent lots of time together, talked on the phone every night that we weren't together all hours of the night, texted each other constantly. We spent each others birthdays together, and everyone around us could tell we were happy together. Fast forward to June and everything seemed to be great. In the middle of the month she went on a trip to Cuba, we told each other we loved each other before we left, spent the day together and it was great. A week and a half later she gets home, I think everything is great since we hit things off once again. She's home for two days, we talked on the phone and I had to go because I had to go eat. I called her back after I ate, and things were completely off. She was quiet, distant, and not interested anymore. I tried figuring out what was wrong, and I couldn't get anything out of her. The next day she told me she was going to the liquor store after work, which I thought was weird since she doesn't drink, and she got mad when I asked her if anything was bothering her. She got drunk on her own at home, and told me how much she loves and missed me. The next day she was distant again, and that afternoon she broke up with me. She then lead me on for a few days following, until she eventually cut me off a week later. I never got a true answer as to why we broke up, and ever since I've felt worse about myself then ever before. I've had a noticeable change in attitude. Family, friends, co- workers have all noticed, and whenever someone reaches out to me I brush it off and pretend I'm fine. She's always on my mind, and it's emotionally draining me. So many things remind me of her, and it's making me hate myself knowing I let the one girl I wanted in my life get away. I've was never the happiest person, and the few months I was with her was the only time I felt true happiness. Since she left me I feel like I've hit rock bottom. Since the end of June I've completely hated myself. I've been holding out on the people that care about me, and even lashing out when they try talking to me. I've been getting set off but the slightest things which isn't fair to any of them. They know something's bothering me and I refuse to talk to them which is making me and everything that comes with it worse","I was never a happy person .

So quick bit of context Im a 17M and I started to acknowledge my social anxiety about 2- 3 years ago. But its really bad. I fear everything. Im actually a really loud and enthusiastic person with a quirky personality but only when Im with people Im comfortable with. But its so easy for me to get that anxious stomach feeling or blush because Im embarrassed over nothing. I blush for just answering a question in college. I blush at reading out a text. I get a crazy amount of anxiety every time I am in a specific English class for some reason. A common sign of anxiety for me is excessive yawning and I do it all through this one class. Im worried that Im sounding arrogant at times and at other times Im worried Im just seeking attention from people. I fear peoples perception of me. Do I look okay? Is my hair alright? Do these clothes look good? What will they think if I? Im just always worried about everything. But generally Im actually one of the most randomly enthusiastic guys in my social groups. Im the one who people find funny because of my general behaviour. Would going to a doctor to seek advice or just diagnose me with anxiety actually help my case? Im not too sure what to do,"in my social groups I m enthusiastic and the most energetic , outside of that I m worried about everything and what everyone thinks of me .

"Also posted this in r relationships but want your guys opinions. As the title says, I've been with my girlfriend 20F for 4 years, and known each other for 7 years. We decided very early to use the pill for birth control, and it worked fine for several years. When I was 18, the birth control failed and she got pregnant. Despite knowing that I did not want a child, she went ahead with the pregnancy, however had a miscarriage. With this, I insisted on changing birth control and we eventually came to the NuvaRing, which worked for a year, before failing in 2016. When she got pregnant for the second time, I made it incredibly clear throughout the whole pregnancy that I did not want the baby. Yet, she still went ahead with it. I am now living at her parents house feeling trapped with no way out, I have resigned myself to living with her and my child and have given up on futher education, I have no friends near her house, and the only joy I have is going back home once or twice every month to spend time with any friends that I haven't lost touch with. I love my child. But I feel like my entire life was stolen away from me by my girlfriend. I want to get out of this situation but I feel like it is too difficult to get out of. I'm forced to smile and act happy for the sake of my child but I am slowly dying inside. As much as I love the child I'm not opposed to being seperated from it to get my life back. On the other hand I feel like it's easier for me to stay and not change anything, despite how unhappy I am.

"Hi this is the first time I have ever really spoken to anyone about myself so apologies if I sound a little all over the place, I'm a 17 year old from the UK who's currently in a very strange, almost surreal frame of mind. It is quite difficult to explain using emotion because part of the problem is well I have very little emotion at all. I feel detached from the emotion world, hanging on physically. I have very little reaction to my surroundings in a normal way, for instance if one of my friends was to be hurt I would not ever feel sad, I could easily play it off however in front of them to fit in better with a group.

I have no sadness, only a constant void of feeling, I guess this evolved as a defense mechanism by my brain to cope with the bad times in my life. However if I was to take part in an activity I enjoy I can feel ""happy""as such, in a very dopamine like way, one small example would be if one of my favourite tracks came on my music player I would feel ""happy""for a bit. I am fully aware however that this is a natural response by my brain and not ""me"". I feel at odds with my own nervous system and my physical needs, like I have somehow separated from myself in a way. Every single action I take I will always subconsciously plan 3 steps ahead to further my own goals. My train of logic would be ""attention say hello - carefully analyse the body language and response in detail to know how to react - respond accordingly""All this may sound quite complicated but I do it really quickly, now you are probably thinking that this is pretty normal. See I only bother doing something if the risk of it is less than the reward, for attention it would be that is the risk of rejection less from the social status reward from talking with someone, a very selfish way of thinking I know. However I find that I am actually really quite good at predicting someones future actions in a social context and how I can manipulate them to my advantage but I just do not bother because there is no emotional reward from doing so, a waste of time. I 100 acknowledge another person's feelings and thoughts however if my goals somehow make someone else feel bad I must do it, however I will take every step I can to reduce the negative impact on someone. This normally involves lies and secrecy but I remain a ""good""friend to people, or so I think. None of my friends know much about me, even after knowing me for a long time, I do this on purpose to distance myself from them. I'm not quite sure why I do this, maybe I am paranoid they will somehow use this information against me at a later date, I don't know. But what I do know is that as a result of this I have two outcomes of this behaviour. One is that I find it rather easy to ""make""friends with people, however I do not feel any social drive or need to most of the time so I never stay out of my comfort zone to meet new people, if I wanted to I could though. Second is that as a result of distancing myself I find it rather difficult to make a close trustworthy friend, someone who I can talk to about shit, someone who will even bother to send me a message rather than me having to initiate the conversation, someone who actually cares about me rather than only me caring about me. I cannot tell my parents about this, it's not that I have a bad relationship with them, I just couldn't there is no benefit for myself doing that and it will just make their lives worse by doing so. Because I have no real close buddies or real emotion it probably comes to no surprise that I have never had a girl friend, or one in the foreseeable future. No one apart from my family has ever loved or really cared about me, probably the reason why I protect my own interests so much. ""if""an opportunity came up where I could get in a relationship I probably would decline even though it would make me worse off in the long term, this is because I emotionally cannot ""love""someone right now, I just cannot care for someone else. Living in the UK with ginger hair is probably the worst thing for trying to do anything social, discrimination towards ginger haired people is seen as normal and supported yet somehow racism isn't? It makes no sense how calling someone black is worse than ginger. Ginger haired people are given the immediate assumption as losers, nerds, weak, stupid and easy targets to make fun of. I have no emotional response to this as such, only a deep thought about ""How much better would my life be if I never inherited these stupid genes ""My personality can be split into two different areas, note I do not have two different personalities but two main focuses I am usually thinking of. My first is very bleak and negative the typical depression mindset, seeking solitude most of the time since I see no positive value of interacting with my friends or bothering to do anything at all. All this side of thinking cares about it playing video games all the time. I do not enjoy many games as such, what this side of my personality really enjoyed is ""winning"". I get a very strong psudo- happiness from beating other people at something, it so happens I am quite good at games so this is the go to medium for this need. Seeing myself at the top of a leaderboard really boosts my mood, failing to meet this requirement however can really take a toll on myself, this side of the brain will constantly ponder over why exactly I did not achieve this, and what can be done to improve. Nothing productive comes from this, just wasted time and makes me feel like shit. If I could change this frame of mind to my education I think that it would really make my academic mind improve since it currently is the bear minimum to succeed. My second side of thinking is my very detached and analysing thinking. The number one priority of this side is survival, no matter what. I never ever want to die. I cannot ever stop thinking about how anything I ever was, will do, invested in or anything else will be erased after death. For eternity. This really makes almost every task pointless in this frame of mine. A logical response would be to make the most of the time I have. But this side of thinking responds to that with ""Well why exactly? What is the point of even trying to do anything when it will all be erased from the universe. My brain is the only thing that matters in this world, anything that gets in my way of survival can fuck off because after I'm dead anything else is 100 irreverent "". Any family, friends or whatever who cared for me means fuck all to this side of my brain because they mean nothing to a dead person. Everyday I ponder about my disappearance from the universe, almost in denial of it. I can probably bet that if this thinking didn't appear then suicide may have been a leap that could have been considered, thankfully this is incompatible with my way of thinking","I am depressed , have been for about 4 years , not a sad kind of depressed but a lonely kind , voided of any emotion . I have adapted to living with it , it has shaped my as a person . But coming up is university and I want to take some steps to try sort myself out . Every second I am in fear of dying .

"Might be a long one but I need some help. Also fair warning this is a real downer. My mother has been in a relationship for around 16 years. They had my little brother about one year into the relationship he is 15 I'm 22 . The relationship always seemed strained. They fought all the time over everything from money to what color the walls should be in the house although at this point in time he did not live with us, he was kinda controlling . About 4 years ago I left to attend a university and he decided to move in with my mother and his son. This is where things got worse for my mother. She would tell stories about how he put her down all the time and would do things to make her feel like less of a person. I have never considered my mother to be a mentally stable person but she became more and more paranoid after he moved in. She stared to lose touch with reality all the way to the point where she would say things like the government was turning off her cellphone and hackers were waving hello to her over flash players. I never really witnessed the psychological abuse and to some extent I wondered if my mother was exaggerating things she is well known to do this . However, about a year ago it got to the point where I knew for certain he needed to go. I didn't want to force out the father of my little brother who is the most important person in the world to me but what he was doing to my mother couldn't be overlooked. I told my mother I would not stay with her over breaks and stuff as long as he lived there and she needed to get rid of him. She filed for a restraining order against him that was served to him the day after Christmas. He took his things and left. Then he committed suicide, a couple hours later. Now his family blames my mother for what happened and might not let her attend the funeral. I have also found out that in the weeks leading but to this that he may have been telling my little brother that he might kill himself I am unable to confirm this myself yet . He may have even told him that he didn't love him. My little brother doesn't have anyone staying with him that really liked his dad and their all kinda mad at him now. I just want to be there for him. I know he knew that my relationship with his dad wasn't perfect but we were friends. Except how he treated my mother he seemed like a good guy. Reddit, I love my little brother so much and he obviously doesn't want to talk about it but I need to help him out. Please do you have any advice about what I can say to help him?","Need advice about what to say to my little brother whose dad committed suicide .

"I am falling apart all over again. For a long time I survived without medication and just knowledge gained on how to deal with my social anxiety. I do have anxiety and it can be a huge burden at work and home. Now I feel that every moment I am without professional help I grow closer to being alone, homeless, and at a point where I do not care what happens next. Actually there are many moments of my day lately where I do not care. I would say it is being lazy about work, hobbies, or relationships but it is just like it is to much. I feel heavy all over. I can hardly sleep most nights and then once or twice a week I get so tired and sleep for 15 hours straight. I am head of my household. My girlfriend is also going through stuff right now. I told her but she just does not understand the issue. She was raised differently when it comes to mental illness and she has no understanding of how bad it is. I try not to worry her right now because she just needs to live her life. I have my father who lives with us but does not work. They are in poor condition themselves and just pity themselves so much he will not get up and do anything for himself. He is so old now that it does not matter and I do not have the heart to toss him to the road. So what I am saying is I have no outlets. I feel cornered by my own feelings. I need professional help and probably medication. I make money but it all goes to debts debts built up by my depressed driven mind 30k debt and rent and utilities. I hardly have anything left to get health insurance or pills. I make too much to be on a free plan I live in Los Angeles . My current clients are just super stressful and I feel horrible for not completing work like I used to. My hours at work were reduced due to lack of performance. So this adds to my financial issues. I am a web developer so I have multiple clients but my highest source of income has reduced my hours from 40 down to maybe 8 hours a week. Financially that hurt but I am managing. I have my gf, who lives with me. She pays for food and a couple shared bills. So it helps. But I need more income to get help. I dont have it in me to work harder to get help. I really want to just leave everything behind. I want to go somewhere that no one will recognize me and I want to wither away by myself. I just drag so much baggage in reality and mentally. I am beyond overwhelmed. I do not know what to do. I tried a few free chat sites and I have to be honest that free chats are not as good as a real therapy. Some of the advice from listeners was even bad advice So in short I do not believe I found the right listener or I really need medication to help my anxiety and depression",I am going to lose my jobs .

"Hello everyone, My name is Dallas, and I am an addict. Let me preface this by saying that I do not have any suicidal thoughts or tendencies, but I would appreciate everyone's advice. Today, I followed a post on r opiates about this subreddit, so I headed over here because lately I have been feeling like shit. Where to start, where to start. I'll start with my background, I guess. I should not be feeling like this. I have two supporting parents, who are now divorced, and a younger brother. Even though they support me financially, by paying for school and rent, etc, they don't quite support me emotionally. I go to school across the country CA so it's hard for them to support me, I get that since they live in Connecticut. My dad basically only cares about me playing baseball, and my mom guilt trips for basically everything. This has caused me to feel lonely and isolated. To combat this loneliness, I used drugs. I don't have a preference for a drug. I enjoy every type of drug. Marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, opiates, basically anything. When I take drugs, it ""cures""these feelings of anxiety and insecurity that I feel. It got so bad, that I was taking opiates, cocaine, and benzodiazepines everyday. When I was doing this, I isolated my friends and family. I burnt many bridges with my friends, which made me even more lonely. One day, I decided to quit and become sober. I thought being sober was going to be a good thing for me, and it was for the first month. However, during the first month of sobriety, I didn't really have any friends anymore because I burnt all those bridges. No one wants to be friends with a drug addict in college. This made me even more lonely. Currently, I am typing this under the influence of opiates because today was just a shitty day for me. I needed to feel something. I wanted to be comfortably numb. If people won't be my friends, drugs will. Drugs don't discriminate. They will be your friend anytime you need one. Last night, I decided to watch a movie called ""Visioneers""on Netflix. Basically, it's about a person who goes through the monotony of life, only to realize that ""Happiness means being happy"". At the end of the movie, he becomes happy in his life. This made me think about my life. I go through the monotony of life and I believe that I am becoming apathetic. I don't feel anything, except for anxiety, insecurity, and depression. It feels as though I put on a mask to make others feel good and joyous, however, at the same time, I feel empty. I believe this is due to the drugs. I have no sex drive, no hunger, etc. I guess I want to make other people happy, so that maybe they will reciprocate and do the same for me, but it rarely happens. I feel like I am lost in life. I don't know what to do with my life, emotionally. I treat my body like shit, my friends like shit, and my family like shit. I feel as though my life doesn't have a purpose any more. I just really have no idea what I can do to make me happy. I thought the answer was drugs, but it only makes me happy for a short amount of time. I know that drugs aren't the solution to my problems. This is why I came here. After reading many posts, it seems as though this community can help me out trying to make sense of my life. Please help","I 'm a drug addict that feels empty inside . No happiness or any feelings of joy . I have isolated myself from my friends and family through my past use of drugs .

"I dont know what all neuro- weirdness I have besides ADHD but I know it's a lot, but I think I might have mild bipolar bc I'm manic and depressed in cycles. The reason I bring this up is because I think the coupling of this with ADHD is what is giving me my issue with work online. For context I am a sex worker and I do this on reddit. I do not care to answer questions about that here nor do I have any intention to promote myself when I say that, I am strictly providing context. Please do not harass me about this I am just doing what I have to do to survive. When I get manic is the only time I'm capable of taking care of myself, answering my clients messages and promoting myself and actually making money. When I'm depressed I am completely incapable of even opening this app to speak to anyone no matter how badly I need to. Actually, the worse i need the money the more anxious about it i get and the more crippled i become. It is so hard to make myself do it bc it takes so much time and upkeep with all these people and very many of them waste my time so I become discouraged from answering any of them. Also I want to add that I am still usually able to make it work like I've always been able to pay my rent doing it it's just a fucking hell of a process and I have to periodically dip out and be absent for months and do something else while I'm gone. I lose so much money and clients doing this bc people dont have the patience to wait that long. I am also so painfully disorganized and cant keep track of any of my files, I am not smart with computers so I dont really know how to do a better job with this I just lose everything all the time just like I do in real life with my physical stuff. It's so discouraging and it makes me feel like shit about myself when I ignore everybody for a month or two and then come back and ask for forgiveness and if they're still interested. Idk if im asking for advice or what I mostly just wanted to rant. I wouldnt even have to do this dumb shit if I could handle working a normal job for more than a month or two but I just fucking cant my body does not understand schedules I cannot get myself places on time or sleep regularly or be able to listen to a boss I just do very poorly in traditional work environments so I have to be self employed most of the time and I cant listen to myself as a boss either and so I just fucken suffer lmao. I'm extra stressing about it right now in particular because this whole month I've been depressed and incapable of doing work but now I have 4 days to come up with my rent money and I dont think thats gonna be enough time. I have tried so hard for weeks up to now to just get myself to power through it but I fucking couldnt until today and I'm so worried it's not going to work out this time. I guess advice would be welcome but I'm mostly just grieving about my ADHD putting me in this fucking situation to begin with",my adhd makes it hard for me to exist in the work force so I am self - employed for the most part but I also really suck at doing that too because of the ADHD making it hard to keep up with anything and stay organized .

"I'm a bit of a compulsive liar. I've been working hard this year to keep it under control, especially because I don't want my boyfriend to be affected by it or even know about it. But when I'm stressed or sad or slipping, the lies just keep pouring out of me. I needed a few days off of work for my mental health. It hadn't hit the point where I was suicidal, which happens about once a month, but I've been so anxious and nervous about working at a large retail store the night of the 23rd and the morning of Christmas Eve back to back that I just decided to call in sick on Monday. Had a nice day, but absolutely dreaded work still. So I came up with a better story, said I got food poisoning, and called out for Tuesday. Today is Wednesday, and I went to work today despite feeling anxious and sad all throughout my morning. I had to explain my absence and spun my web I went out to Applebee's on Friday night, got some chicken, and got sick from it on Sunday all lies. Karma is a bitch, and I started feeling dizzy and nauseated as I went through my shift. Couldn't focus or stand, my hands were shaking as I tried to sort through merchandise, and my coworkers offered to give me an easier job. Then I went to lunch, and realized about halfway through that I wasn't going to be a productive employee for the remainder of a very busy night and would rather go home and rest than try to push myself too hard. Went to the bathroom and pretended that I threw up so I could leave 4 hours early. I'm in bed now, and I need to be back at work in less than 7 hours. I don't know why I keep lying about everything. I've been sad and anxious and depressed and thought that some time off would help me feel better, but this web I've created is causing me even more anxiety. I hate myself for doing this. I can't keep my stories straight because everyone thinks I'm doing something different with my time.

"I've had a clue that I've had ADHD Inattentive since Junior year of high school. I've always had trouble keeping up with assignments, and I've always been told that I'm smart but I don't work hard enough. Every year and every semester was the one that I was going to do better and try harder. I was going to keep up with my assignments. Well, every time I burnt out quick and couldn't keep up. It always took me 3- 4 times as much time to get assignments done. I've been doggy paddling my way through community college and just got a liberal arts degree. I've got a decent GPA too, but that's only because I gave up hope working for a computer science degree and dropped the hard classes before I failed them. I sank to taking easy classes and biding my time. Now I'm out of time. I'm 21 and most of my friends are away at real schools. I'm stuck in New Jersey's version one horse town, working at a supermarket. I have a lot of respect for degree's like computer science, engineering, and pharmacy and I want to do something real with my potential, but I know that the course load will overwhelm me and I'll get frustrated and burn out. Instead I've been sitting here biding my time thinking about what degree could I manage to get. ""Well sociology sounds easy. To bad I hate social work. I could complete a BA in communications. To bad I'm socially awkward and have misanthropic tendencies. I'm a terrible communicator.""I keep searching for an easy way through college so I could get a miserable degree, but most of them will hardly get me a job in this climate. The worst part is knowing that I wouldn't be reaching my potential. After browsing r adhd for a bit and having still not picked out classes for next semester next week I just found the courage to talk to my mom about adhd. Both of my parents act as if there's no such thing as mental disorder. They often make jokes about how there's a pill for everything. ""To happy? To sad? Here's your pill.""My parents life view is that it's all in your head. Hey depressed people, new breakthrough! you should try to stop being sad all the time! You'd be much happier! My sister is in pharmacy school and she fills my parents full of horror stories about people selling and abusing ADHD meds. She tells them that it's ""Just like Meth""and the kids who take it turn into zombies. So, I talked to my mom about ADHD this morning because I'm at my wits end and need to move my life forwards. She is super against the medicine and is trying to tell me I don't have ADHD. She knows what it's like to struggle with bookwork because ""It's normal""She exhibits ADD symptoms herself She struggled through college, became a grade school teacher for two years, married my father and then lived happily ever after as a stay at home mom. She's really just out of touch after 25 years of sitting around. My father went to school for health education, and landed a cop job and spent the rest of his life with that. He's the mentally tough type who works out religiously, and never uses caffeine. I don't want to say that my parents had it easy, but they are really not able to empathize with my struggles. My mom basically told me I shouldn't go to the doctor, he'll just give me pills and send me on my way. I'll find another way without dangerous drugs. Lots of people go through this when transitioning in college life. I'm sitting at the table pouring my heart out about how I've felt inadequate and held back and here's the reason why. She's telling me I need to find another way. I've been trying to do that since grade school. She also suggested that when my dad hears about this he's probably gonna start yelling","My parents do n't believe that they could produce a child with a mental disorder .

"Backstory to the odd question I'm a student with divorced parents, and alternate between parents' houses every couple of days. One loves to always give me tons of food, which I think is removing some of my adhd symptoms. When I eat something with a lot of calories, I'll be able to focus really well on something admittedly it's usually something I'd like to be doing anyways while still maintaining my rapid thoughts that help me come up with ideas produce higher quality work. It can also help with anxiety and stress sometimes, which could be a pretty big help in some situations. The effect is amplified when I have a large amount of sugar in a candy or something, but a couple hours after I eat it I'll get pretty stressed out and want to eat more, so I try to avoid that. I've heard things about candy foods providing the brain with dopamine which could help someone focus, but I've never heard of anyone actually using something like this to treat their adhd. This effect is actually quite different from being on meds though, after eating a lot of food I'm quicker to come up with ideas, and I'm more motivated to do homework and make programs on my spare time something that's still fun but challenging for me . I'm still kind of erratic after eating, and can't see myself doing something I don't like for long hours, but it's a much improved state over how I usually am. I'm just generally happier and less stressed out anxious after eating, which makes me wonder anyone else gets this same effect. One theory I have is that food doesn't cause the body to release norepinephrine like stimulants do, so I'm more calm but still have a good focused feeling. It would be cool to get other people's points of view on this, since I haven't seen this being discussed anywhere","eating a lot of food helps me focus in a similar way that meds do , but also helps with stress anxiety as an added bonus . I 've never seen this discussed and would like to hear your point of view .","I think eating a lot of food helps my adhd symptoms, but I've never heard of anyone actually using it to treat their adhd.","I think eating a lot of food helps with my adhd symptoms, but I'm not sure if anyone else experiences this as well.","I think eating a lot of food helps me with my adhd, but I'm not sure if it's because of the body releasing norepinephrine like stimulants do, or because the food itself doesn't have much of an effect on the brain.

"The reason I have it 3.050 3.25 is because I am taking Developmental Courses and a Developmental Program. To clarify I have done terrible in High School, no medication, and did not meet the requirements to just go straight into college, however, after taking the program I am rather glad I didn't as it helped me, as well as my GPA. So, two weeks in, after taking a mandatory visit to the school counselor, she said I may have A.D.D from what I've told her She asked about my grades, I told her it was hard to pay attention what really got her to believe I had A.D.D was the fact that even though when talking to her, my mind wandered off after 5 to 10 seconds, sometimes in mid sentence . My mother managed to get my pediatrician although I was 18 to fill a one time subscription of Concerta, in which case I didn't know that I was in fact diagnosed with it as a child, but I was taken off of it because of the side effects. After taking it, I felt as if a fog that I did not know existed had cleared I swear, I felt as if I could do anything. That summer semester, I actually ended up losing quite a bit of weight from using the Concerta, and my grades improved. Before, I couldn't even write down notes my professor was saying, but after I could concentrate much clearer, and although at times I zoned out, I could control it and get back to paying attention instead of like before. I had a 3.5 GPA that semester, an A in US History, non- dev class, and a B in a Composition 101 class, a dev class which doesn't count towards my GPA. However, my GPA showed and recorded both of them as courses. In between Summer and Fall, I got to see a psychiatrist for the first time, and he started prescribing me medication, and eventually I swapped to Adderall, which helped me get throughout the day since I've been studying for 6 and up hours a day for five courses. Lost 25 pounds since entering college due to Medication, feels good. However, I felt as if, even though prior to medication I couldn't study for more than 20 minutes without my mind wandering, I had to take longer to study and retain it, as I was still bored while reading it, it's just I could actually read without it being impossible. I've been having to read and highlight over a hundred pages to study for a chapter, however I have a feeling that others could do so in 3 or less. Six hours to eight hours to write the definitions, why it was important, when it happened, and what happened, for only 50 definitions I had my notes, it wasn't like I had to read through my text book didn't have one, had to rely on notes, in which I missed quite a few because of my mind wandering . Although I studied for six to eight hours a day sometimes, I feel as if I could have done it a lot faster and retained more of what I studied. Another problem was anxiety, as when I actually took the test, I ended up forgetting most of what I studied the night s before and did bad due to it. This semester, I got a 2.87 GPA, and combined a 3.050GPA however, three of them were non- dev courses, two of which were developmental, and so they do not count. Using a third- party calculator, I only got a 3.25GPA Four courses and it's pathetic so much studying yet I couldn't hit 3.5 for that scholarship I have one more semester, Spring 2013 however, I have a feeling that it won't work for me my dosage of Adderall already feels as if it isn't enough and I'm going to be taking Pre- Calc, Programming, and Ugh Public Speaking","Struggled with A.D.D A.D.H.D all of my life , did n't know I had it because mother kept it from me and took me off because of the side effects Entered college , but had to get administered through a developmental program for kids who had terrible grades like me in High School .

My mother works full time and is going for her Master 's degree , is getting above 3.75 , even gets a perfect 4.0 feel inadequate in comparison like I 'm letting her down So , what would be a good GPA ? Would having ADD ADHD even be a valid excuse , especially now that I am medicated ? Sure , I have problems paying attention at times , but I feel as if I can do a LOT better What are your differences in GPA since being medicated ? What would be a good or acceptable GPA for someone with ADD ADHD ?","I have a 3.25 GPA, but I feel as if I could have done it faster and retained more of what I studied.

I am looking for advice on how to study and retain what I have studied, as I feel that I could do it in less than six hours and still retain it. I would also like to note that before medication, I couldn't study for more than 20 minutes without my mind wandering. After medication, my mind was much clearer and I could control it much better, but it still took me longer to read and comprehend what I was reading, but after medication, it wasn't like I was bored while reading it, it's just I could actually read without it being impossible. I could focus much better on the material, and was able to pay attention much better. I also lost 25 pounds since entering college due to medication, which helped with my ADHD. My question is how can I get my GPA up to 4.0 for the four courses I have left, and still maintain my scholarship? How can I study for six hours without it taking me over eight hours to do so? I have no idea how to do it, and it feels as if others could do so in 3 or less. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"This is going to be a rant Since the new semester started I've been taking my first AP class. While I'm a good student this feels like a step up for me and I am trying my hardest to stay on top of things. However, there is a very distracting and loud group of people in my class who make it impossible to focus during work time. I've tried talking to my teacher, bringing in noise- canceling headphones, and sitting outside but I could still hear them each time. The teacher does not understand how much the noise negatively affects my concentration and mood even though I've talked to her about it and I have a note on my 504 plan about it . So today I went to my counselor and I have to move to a completely different part of the school to get work done now. I find this solution annoying but it'll probably be better for me in the long run. One of the ways I am trying to stay on top of things is writing notes on my laptop and then rewriting them into a notebook in my free time. As of now, I am rewriting all of my vocab and simplifying it. I shared my color- coded notes in a study server that I am in and multiple people laughed and asked why I was ""writing with crayons"". I don't have highlighters because I've lost them all so I was using colored pencil They also told me that my notes are childish and should be better for my grade. I've struggled with taking notes for all of high school so I don't have much practice with notes. I was ready to get working when I sat down and opened my laptop but seeing those messages making fun of my work makes me feel terrible. I don't know how coherent this sounds as my meds have worn off so I'm a bit scatterbrained at the moment. All of these things happened today within a few hours of each other and I don't have any motivation to work anymore.

Background Depression and Anxiety Previously had a psychotic episode Experimented with drugs mostly Cannabis, Ecstasy, LSD, MDMA but no longer History of mental illness - Mum amp sister have depression, Uncle is a paranoid schizophrenic Since February this year I have been experiencing symptoms of Psychosis. For the past few months I have had visual hallucinations religious or historical figures , and ideas of reference of people trying to communicate to me specifically through my TV. I decided to see a psychiatrist and he concluded I do not currently have psychosis as of 28 06 2016 . I've also had minor catatonic behaviour such a difficulty putting s sentence together lots of ums and erms in my sentences . I also saw a team of specialists who specialise in psychosis intervention and they concluded that my behaviour is a product of my anxiety. Recently I've had some strange thoughts but I don't think of them as delusions. I've has strange thoughts that a higher being is watching me, and people are trying to harm me eg. EVERYONE I pass is trying to mug me stab me beat me up . I've also had thoughts that people are injecting HIV positive blood in my food, so much so that I actually a full sexual health check up. I am not sexually active and haven't been for a year. I thoughts that such thoughts were quite normal but when I pointed them out to a friend they thought it sounded pretty delusional, but I can't help but think this is a rational thought? As a homosexual male it's something that I should be concerned about, but I can't draw the line between delusion and concern for this topic. Maybe it's my anxiety but I can't accept the fact that I don't currently have psychosis.

"While experiencing hypomania can be a wondrous experience where fluttering ideas come from out of nowhere, I tend to abhor the feeling afterwards. It seems like a counterfeit self afterwards. Those optimistic thoughts are now hampered by dull thoughts. I feel I could use meditation to find a placid place in my min but that rarely happens after a hypomanic stint. It seems like an abrasive course of ebbs and flows in life.

"I wish I had figured this out sooner because I would have been so much more productive in my university career.

I will often have to read entire pages or paragraphs over again because I zoned out, or get so painfully bored I have to ""take a break.""A lot of my papers are based off of readings, so I can't finish papers until I do the readings so this creates a vicious cycle of procrastination and guilt.

I cant really blame them, since none of us knew why I was the way I was, but I think what really would have helped was understanding how my brain worked. Having her diagnosis as early as you do, it might be helpful to really help her understand whats going on inside her head and to understand that it doesnt have to be a bad thing. Giving the whys, not only why something needs to be done, but also why it might be more difficult for her. Help her find things that work for her. They may not be how normal people do them, but if they work, they work. Research techniques designed specifically for people with adhd I dealt with a lot of apathy due to low self confidence. I was unable to focus, and not knowing why, I convinced myself I was stupid and there was no point in trying even though Im actually pretty smart, I just couldnt focus to get my work done . If shes not on medication, maybe look into it. I think it really would have helped me when I was younger by giving me the extra boost to finally reach my full potential and build the skills necessary to do better","find techniques that work for her adhd brain , do nt force her to use common neurotypical ones .

"To add onto this, try to have a schedule. If you don't have something you should be doing, like on the weekend, you should still try to start the day and accomplish something. Once you wake up, get up and make your bed. Then eat, take a shower, and get dressed. Once you have done that, try to get out of the house and accomplish some small thing. Buy some groceries that you don't have for dinner that night. Buy some coffee or fill up the gas tank. Take a walk around a park or a city block. Whatever it is, just do SOMETHING.

"When I was 13, I had a boyfriend I thought I was in love with. Teenage relationships will be teenage relationships, though. We broke up, he started seeing someone else, I still ""loved""him. A few months later, in August 2010, I was swimming in his pool with him, my best friend, and his little brother. I guess here is where I should say that we were there because my friend was babysitting his brother. He couldn't do it because, at 15, he'd already been to court and been forbidden from being alone with his brother, because he'd molested him, and his sisters, already. While we were swimming, he started touching me and my friend, too. Grabbing our breasts, shoving his fingers between our legs, jabbing at us with his erection through his swim trunks. I was so stupid. I thought, maybe if I let him do this he'd like me again. I did tell him no. ""Not yours.""Don't touch there.""Stop it.""But I guess I wasn't firm enough, he kept doing it.

When I stopped Ritalin for good at 20, I became all but a zombie, sleeping over ten hours a day and suffering a distinct fatigue for years despite a much higher than average caffeine intake.

It's been helping a lot for me to actually get done the stuff I need to do, which helps with my anxiety too. But for insurance reasons I need to find a new doctor.

"I have had a massive amount of guilt for the past 12 years. I was just entering high school at the time and I had a hard time fitting in. My bullies put me in headlocks and called me names. One of the bullies who we will Jose called me a Twinkie and would poke me. These comments hurt me deeply but I held in my anger. Eventually I had to sit next to Jose in a class. I thought I would just ignore him. Right away he started complaining that I should sit somewhere else. I didn't see the big deal and ignored his poking name calling. However, a week later I didn't know what we were doing in class I have a minor learning disability and asked a guy behind me. Jose was annoyed with my actions for whatever reason so he kept poking me with his compass through my sweatshirt. I should note that his compass had a very sharp edge. Well apparently this point went through my sweatshirt and I had 40 small puncture wounds The nurse got really mad as it kept bleeding . I called him a fucking Mexican after he kept doing it. That was dumb on my part as he kept stabbing me. A teacher later saw this and took me to the principals office. There Jose admitted to everything I tried to go easy on him but he admitted to everything and he was suspended. He was recommended for expulsion but was only suspended for a week. After this I fell into a deep depression and hated the world. There were some girls that I had been friends with who kept asking me why I got Jose in trouble. My male friends understood everything that happened and none of the guys liked Jose. But he was very popular with the girls. This caused me to explode and call one girl who was black the n word more than once . I know how bad it was and I regret it to this very day. She didn't deserve that. I just wanted to burn down everything around me. I felt like no one cared about me. Nothing came from this situation and I don't understand why. The whole event reminded me of when my grandfather strangled me and no one cared. I felt the same hear and let out all my anger at once. To this day I have hated my decision and am scared that it can up back up. For example I was in talks with a book publisher and then pulled out over fears of my past.

" wasnt sure if this should go in r relationships or here so well see what happens For a while now I have believed to have some sort of attention disorder. I have wanted to go and get tested for so long, however I live in the US and my insurance only covers part of the cost, I would still have to put up a lot of money that I dont have. When brought up to my parents they just said they were afraid to put me on medication as it would change my behavior. Signs that I may have ADHD is stuff like never being able to focus on a task given to me, constantly feeling like Im behind on work even if Im not, becoming hyper- fixated on an idea and obsessing over it for a period of time, and never processing what Im thinking before I say it out loud. The last symptom is why Im making this post today. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 7 months and shes honestly one of the best things to ever happen in my life. She kind, understanding, goofy, and overall a great person. Last night we were cuddling in bed together, making jokes about each other when I accidentally impulsively called her a whale and she is obviously upset with me. Whats weird is that I legitimately dont think shes fat. While her body type is not like that unrealistic standard of skinny you see everywhere, she is still skinny and even if she wasnt I wouldnt love her any less. I dont know why I said that, I honestly dont mean it. I think my brain just randomly thought to say it, and I blurted it out w o thinking. This is an issue that has happened multiple times in our relationship, and I want to fix myself so that I can be the partner she deserves. So what is some advice for people w ADHD who have a hard time thinking before speaking?","I believe I have ADHD , I sometimes accidentally say hurtful things to my girlfriend even when I do nt mean it because I do nt think about what I say before I say it .","I accidentally called my gf a whale while we were cuddling and she s upset with me.

"They took my 26F boyfriend 21 to the hospital. They kept him overnight and were going to take him to a psych hospital. The doctor saw the text he sent me about wanting to kill him self and wanted to admit him. He got his phone back and was messaging while I was at work saying he was going to the hospital and a ton of horrible things about me ruining his life. I asked how he has his phone and if they were already transferring him to the hospital. He said no that he got his stuff back and was arguing with the staff about going. During that time he sent me a message saying when he finds a way out of the hospital he will kill himself. He talked his way out of it and was able to go home. I left work early because I was so upset about everything. When I found out he had gotten home I was so afraid he would kill him self since just a few hours before he said he would make sure hed do it. So I call the cops again. I get more angry messages when the cops show up. When I get a call back from the cop they said they couldnt do anything. This was the same officer as the night before. I told him that just a few hours ago he said he would find a way to get out of the hospital and then kill him self. The cop basically said they cant just force him into the hospital every time he says that. I also mentioned how he told me when I asked if he was really going to do it, he said he was. The cop said his story was he did it for attention and was not going to actually go through with it. I dont believe that at all and know that he was going to that night. The cop said I could go to probate court and get some court ordered document that would force him to be evaluated more in depth. He said with the text I have they would grant that. My boyfriend said he wanted to talk and when I said we could meet up and talk about it he got mad and said he didnt want to. He said he wants to break up with me. February wouldve been two years of us being together and we were planning on getting a house and then getting married in a few months. We work together so I saw him today. I couldnt stop crying the whole way there and back. I tried my hardest to not cry too much on the job but I did about every 15- 20 minutes and would have to use the little energy I had to stop. Im so mentally and emotionally exhausted. He is still so angry and refuses to talk to me in person about this. I wish I wouldnt have called the cops. If it was for attention wed still be together and everything would be back to normal. If it wasnt for attention and he actually went through with it then I wouldve just went right behind him and we both wouldnt be in so much pain.

"I came here because I'm having the same issues! I've been on Adderall XR 30mg for 5- 6 years. After graduating college and starting my first full time job, I would take at least one day off meds a week. I started finding it hard to wake for work after my day off. For the last 2- 3 months I've been taking my medication everyday. My new doctor told me that since my ADHD didn't take the weekends off why should I. That seemed logical and solved my Monday morning problem. However, now my meds just don't seem to be working at all. I've actually been a complete mess for the last 2 months w out ever considered it was my medication. I'm late for work everyday. When I'm at work idgaf about anything and just want to sleep. It is taking me hours to do what use to take 10 minutes at most ex. spending an hour replying to an email . I'm browsing on my phone all day like now . My room, my car, even my office at work are all a mess which is very unusual for me. I'm also extremely hungry throughout the day. Although, it was a nice surprise to get my appetite back I had the same issues in college. My previous doctor told me it wasn't possible for Adderall to make me tired. She wanted me to have a sleep study done, even though I had one a year before. So I let it go thinking maybe I did just need more sleep. Fast forward to present - same issues. Now I definitely know it is my medication. This past Saturday I ate breakfast, took my meds, and sat down to have some lovely focused gaming time and woke up 6 hours later like - wtf? oh aha! Honestly I'm not even annoyed, just happy I can pinpoint the problem so I can fix it. ","Adderall XR not working after taking daily for a few months .

"Hello, I'm from Turkey too. I've graduated from high school in 2014. My first time on LYS was a failure. I wanted to try again but my family claimed that I couldn't take that stress once again. I think they just wanted to avoid other family members seeing my failure. With this bad motivation, I've chosen the bad path and started to college in the computer engineering department not computer science, computer engineering. Dumbass naming tho This fucked my life so hard. I'd gone to a rural area for the ""university"". Don't let the name fool you, that place was worse than a highschool. Standard rural area University, less than 300 points. Computer engineering should worth more than 450 points, which is on ITU or Bogazici University. Not that university- ish shitplace I've set my foot in. At the end of that year, I've taken these tests for the second time, failed harder. I was on my way to end my own life, I had to live my life in a place I didn't want and I started to hate computers. I thought that I liked codes, computers etc. but I wasn't suited to learn these all. Its all because my math knowledge sucks. I know there's not much time left, but if you want to succeed, make sure you work hard especially for math tests. Whatever, on my story something awesome happened. I learned that it's possible to change university using the first exam's degrees. I've taken that option. Now I'm in a university which is much better, than the previous one. I've made some of my best friends from there. I'm studying on better subjects and omg, that's awesome","I was about to end my life , learned that I can change my situation and done that immediately , because I was able to so .

"Hahha I know that feeling, sometimes when I'm crying and complaining to my partner I complain about this xD ""GOD IM SO TIRED OF WORKING TO BE HAPPY"". I think it's less of 'more natural' and more like more something you're used to. Bpd is the roadmap were used to, no matter how twisted and dysfunctional it is. Years and years of reacting to things the same way have made us comfortable. Being happy and positive is new, and rewiring your brain to automatically take those routes also will take years to lay down the foundations. So it's normal for you to feel relief and even joy in going back to old, comfortable ways. Here is a great time to practice dialectics. You can both enjoy the relief of letting go and resorting to old ways, and you can also celebrate how hard you've worked to become a more emotionally healthy you, rest and get back at it. There's no need to hate yourself or hate your old ways, they served you well before, and now it's time to get out of your comfort zone because you recognize there's more to the world out there. Kind of like how in order to lose weight, it's better to go slow and still allow for foods you enjoy and cheat days, instead of cutting everything out, as long as you're mindfully doing it and hold yourself accountable",really get into eating a taco bell while frowning and listening to emo music then get back to lifting those smile muscles tomorrow,"It's normal to feel relief and joy in letting go of the comfortable ways, but it's time to get out of your comfort zone and see there's more to the world out there.","It's normal to feel relief and even joy in going back to old ways, but it's also normal to want to get out of your comfort zone and see the world in a different way.","It's normal to feel relief and even joy in letting go of comfortable ways, but it's also a good time to practice dialectics.

"SORRY FOR THE LONG POST YOU'RE GOING TO READ, I HAD TO VENT AND ALSO GET SUPPORT. Also, my first language isn't English, so apologies. Before going further, just know that I love both of my parents more than anything in this world. Both my parents came from a poor background and became rich together. They went through A LOT of hardships when THEY were just teenagers both parents in the hospital together amp legal fights all at the same time for my mom, and similar stuff for my dad . They never wanted me to go through any tough time, so they became this protective people who never let me do anything by myself. I'm the only child and so I was pampered and given everything that was asked. Of course, I didn't become a bully coz I was also taught to be nice to people at all times. Every problem I had was dealt by them without even me requiring to put an effort. This I feel made me weak and I don't know how to deal with people and most importantly, how to stand up for myself and be assertive. In the mean time, my parents were kinda going through a rough patch and I was the thing holding them together. I started isolating myself from everything and staying in my room watching porn and got addicted since the age of 14. My grades went down, lost my friends, and I think that's where I started being afraid of speaking up for myself and went inside a shell. All these problems hit me the hardest 2 years ago, when my dad passed away. We went from being one of the richest in the city, to below middle class in a day. If it wasn't for my mom's savings and a home, we would have been broke and on the streets. All this happened when I had just joined my MBA and it kinda took a toll on my grades as well coz now I had a few more things to worry about other than my studies. I'm in a situation now where I've to start almost everything from the scratch except for a home of course, but this isn't my complaint at all. I've always wanted to be free from my dad's shadow coz I don't want to be just known as ""His son""if it makes sense I sometimes blame it on my mom coz she was the over protective one who most of the times didn't let me go out with my friends. I have NEVER travelled out of my state in my entire life. I could just go to a few neighbouring cities only after a background check of my travel partners This happened till I was 20 and my dad passed. I never travelled after that anywhere since I had studies pressure of providing for the household on me by myself My mom has always told that there was no fault of hers. All she did was protect me. That's her go- to answer. I have NEVER seen her accept something that she has done wrong and apologised for it. We had a big fight regarding this a month or so ago but even then she was like ""Tell me one thing that I've done wrong with you""that's where I realised I cannot argue with her. That and if I prove something right she plays that mental game where tears roll down and I feel bad about that, so I just gave up. My problem is that, all that pampering and taking care of me has led me to be this person who has no confidence and no people skills at all. I'm finding it difficult to be confident even at something as simple as an interview for a job. I'm not even confident enough to talk to women creeping them and pushing them away. Other than that, I've always been a guy who never took life seriously and was having fun all the time just playing video games and things with 0 people interaction . So now that I'm faced with living in the real world, I'm having a tough time. I feel like I'm in this zone where I want my old life back where everything was done for me, but I can't come to terms with the fact that I have to grow up and take charge of my life, and that I don't know where to begin. I know there are people going through worse stuff and have emerged out of it, but I haven't dealt with this pressure of providing for the household where someone was dependent on me ever before in my life. I feel like I'm breaking under the pressure. ","My parents had be been protective of me since I was born and I have developed this thing where I have 0 confidence and have no idea how to deal with people .

"I identify heavily with a lot of what I have read about how people's brains work when they have ADHD. But I also have had many symptoms of OCD in the past, including intrusive thoughts that I can not get out of my head, themes that I kept returning to.

"Whenever a therapist or psychiatrist explained to me that I'm depressed because of ""serotonin imbalance""it always made me so angry. Boiling down all my pain and mental problems to a single neurotransmitter imbalance just pissed me off because pharmaceutical companies have so much power and influence that all prescription guidelines put so much faith in the serotonin theory and so psychiatrists are trained to prescribe SSRIs with little impunity. While I don't doubt serotonin plays a role in depression, i believe it's an effect, not a cause of depression. Depression is a multifactorial issue with everyone being different, and psychiatrist prescribe everyone the same ssris until they find a dosage combo that ""works"".

"First time poster in here. Title says it all. He got really mad at me for a small thing that escalated into an argument. My dad used to blow up and be really angry when I was younger, but the past few years have been pretty good no anger explosions . This thing really triggered some pretty awful childhood memories, and now Ive lost all the trust Id built with my parents. The things he said confirmed all the paranoid thoughts I have each day They want me out of here. Theyre tired of me being alive here. Im a burden to them and they think Im not possible to help. I live with my parents because Im not in enough shape to live by my self. The past two days Ive been in my room all day and I havent talked to my dad yet. Today I spoke to my GP and someone at my psychologists office, and Im going to an emergency meeting there on Monday help is coming I guess I havent been this close to self harming in a couple of years. This whole situation was the last straw in me keeping a somewhat together appearance. Now all I want to to is escape. I feel like a weird mix of a guest and a prisoner in my own home. Im so stressed scared that Ive been locked inside my bedroom since this happened. Not sure what Im looking for by posting this here. Maybe sympathy. Maybe some advice. Maybe someone to relate to.

"Living with anxiety for the majority of my life has allowed me to learn how to cope with it, but sometimes I fall through the cracks and I guess this is just one of those moments. I've been feeling numerous symptoms of anxiety that I know are common heart palpitations, fatigue, but the minute that another symptom that I'm not used to shows up I fall into the spiral of thinking myself into constant worry. I had blood work done this Summer and the results were completely normal, but I find myself thinking what can't be found through the blood work? Some forms of cancer possibly such as brain tumors? I know this exaggeration of thinking is a big stretch, but I can imagine that this is what feelings of hypochondria consist of and at the moment I feel as if I'm in that position.

"I felt something was wrong with mr almost as soon as I started college. The symptoms were there before, but they never really seemed unusual or a hindrance until then. I tried to get evaluated sophomore year of undergrad, when I realized that I was hitting a wall that just wasn't there for my peers, and none of my attempts at ""learning to study""and acquiring self- discipline were working. That went kinda poorly, both because I wanted answers but was too scared to try medication, and because the psychologist evaluating me was really new to the job and seemed confused how I could think I had ADHD when my grades were fine. She decided I had impostor syndrome, and we talked about that for a few months, then I gave up because it wasn't helping. I managed to muddle through undergrad with decent results, but it took a lot of work. In graduate school, I felt like I was struggling even more, and sacrificing even more of my personal life to keep afloat at work. I was struggling enough that I wanted to try medication, so I did some research and found an ADHD screening clinic affiliated with my university. On my first appointment, I stressed that I wasn't concerned because I was struggling in graduate school - my main issue was that I struggled with planning starting projects and staying on task, not the intellectual rigor or workload that was required. I also talked about how thus hindered me outside school making it hard to plan and follow through even fun stuff and hobbies. This time the psychologist seemed more experienced and willing to listen, and she referred me for testing. The testing was 2 part - questionnaires and a computerized test. The questionnaires were one for me and one for someone who knew me well preferably as a child to fill out. The computerized test wasn't like the SAT or anything. It was more a reaction attention span thing - letters popped up on a screen at random intervals, and I had to click when a specific letter came up, and try not to make mistakes. On the computer test, I actually had a pretty borderline score, on the low end of normal. The questionnaires, however, seemed to raise some ADHD flags. I was referred to a psychiatrist to try medication mostly based on the questionnaire results, or so my psychologist said. I started medication and was also enrolled in a support group sort of thing to help develop organization and time management strategies. The group helped, but it was mostly the result from the meds that made me and my doctors pretty sure ADHD was the right diagnosis. I'm really happy with how I'm doing now, and I'm enjoying both work and free time a lot more","sorry this was long . I tried getting diagnosed once unsuccessfully , and later found a doctor who had experience and was a good listener . The tests are n't like the ones at school , I 'd say they are a decent measure of how ADHD you are . Adderall worked for me , yay !

"I'm 20. Since I was fifteen I have been having some sort of anxiety but I'm not sure what it is. A little background, my school has exams every October November and around September I would start having anxiety. It's not anxiety about the exams and not doing well. I would have anxiety about COMPLETELY unrelated stuff, worrying non stop about it. The most common ones for me to have are anxieties about whether or not I'm able to immigrate overseas in future, and a general sense of 'fear of missing out' meaning I will be studying then I realise what a good time other teenagers are having in say, USA or U.K. I live in Singapore, it has a very study printed culture . These may seem like trival worries to you, but I get so caught up with thinking and worrying about it I can't even study or do normal daily life things. Once, when I was 16, I worried and thought about things so much after waking up, I threw up bile. The thing is, the anxiety only occurs during school and exam periods. After the school and exam period, when I'm able to go out and hang out is not grounded by parents to study for exams anymore , the anxiety dissipates. I think being at home having to study intensifies the anxiety?

"Every post has to start somewhere, right? I guess this is the beginning. Some background I currently live with my parents, mom and step- dad, my life donator hasn't been in the picture for a VERY long time so my step- dad is the only dad I've ever had , two younger siblings, my grandmother, and my aunt. Life hasn't been kind to me for a long time, so I have a tendency to hide my emotions and actual thoughts from just about everyone. amp amp POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNINGS ABUSE, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, NEGATIVE SELF- IMAGE EATING DISORDERS amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp amp When I was younger, I went through a crapton of emotional and mental abuse from my grandparents, my aunt, and my step- dad when we moved in with them after my mom married my step- dad. I already had awful anxiety and some depression. As I got older I would be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder. My grandmother also managed to give me such an eating complex and has consistently shattered my self- esteem time and time again. My mom had to deal with the abuse as well, and since I was the oldest and the most mature child, she felt the most comfortable talking to me. ""You and I grew up together.""she likes to say. She was a teen mom. I was 11 when my mom started to tell me about a good bit of her marriage troubles. I was 14 or so when she told me she was going to take me and my siblings and we were leaving my step- dad. I was not to tell anyone of this, so I constantly had it bottled up. Things got a lot better with their marriage and how he treats us, so that's why we still live here. The abuse, the constantly fluctuating state of trust that I have in people, and a multitude of other factors have made me reluctant to tell anyone ANYTHING about my personal life, my real thoughts, or my real feelings on anything. No one particularly cares anyways. They're all busy dealing with their own shit, and I get that to some extent. amp Now, I do have a therapist, and I've known her since I started seeing her at a pretty young age. As things in my life kept happening, I told her most of what happened, leaving out things like how I felt about a situation directly. Or I would lie about how I felt if pressed hard enough for an answer. If it's about my parents, which it has been lately , she does something that I've never had anyone do for me before. She gets angry with my parents on my behalf. She's also of a belief that they enable me greatly and I agree. But anyways, I've started doing a coping mechanism that I'm not super sure is healthy, but idk how to bring it up with my therapist, or anyone really. I write a suicide note when my thoughts get a lil too loud for me to handle. It's just one, and I update it with how I feel at that moment and things I would want to tell people when I eventually leave this mortal coil. I write it in Comic Sans so it doesn't feel so serious, but I sit and I write things I would want to tell people if I only had an hour left to live. It helps to an extent, and it makes people around me less worried than when I used to tell suicide jokes as a way to cope, mainly because no one other than myself knows that it exists. But is it unhealthy? And if it is, how should I bring it up with my therapist? I tried to tell her at my last appointment, but I couldn't get the words to come out. amp","I 'm writing a suicide note as a coping mechanism for my anxiety and depression .

"I am loved by a ton of people. But I am selfish, and I want to be loved MORE. From newer DIFFERENT people. I can't stop it. So in my 20's, I used to fill that void on the internet, meeting girls and having these fake online relationships where they would ""fall in love with me"", and it was the biggest ego boost ever blah blah blah. One of those girls I fell madly in love with and she broke my heart and I haven't been the same since. Oh by the way, I was and am married with children during this entire time. Now, in my 30's, I don't have the desire, drive or even ability to facilitate those types of ego boosts anymore. I've lost it. My mating dances don't work anymore, I'm used goods.

Fortunately I had an appointment with my regular doctor two days later. She had seen the report and was worried about me she told me that she had never seen any evidence of detachment from reality. We were able to look at my specific answers that led the other psych to her conclusion, and my doctor told me that I maybe answered incorrectly BTW T F is bullshit, and everyone knows it largely because of my OCD and classic overthinking.

"Eventually I got tired of constant flows the of paranoid thought patterns regarding the Federal government, so I simply did a bit of research to understand how they actually operate Law enforcement and intelligence agencies are short on funding and personnel. Even with data collection, there is too much information for a handful of agents to track down every last dissident, let alone develop an investigation. Federal prosecutors do not seek indictments unless they have a good chance of a conviction that means they think the accused is guilty and have enough evidence to prove it. It costs money to bring defendents to trial and resources are allocated to cases which will return the desired result.

Im trying anything I can to suppress the urges because Im tired of working so hard to hide my cuts scars from friends and family.

Its been helpful for me twice in a row now for suppressing urges. Anyway, one of the recommendations is to put temporary tattoos where you have an urge to self harm. I didnt have any in my house but instead I used some old pink acrylic paint and painted hearts all over my arms.

"So, I was diagnosed with ADHD type 2 formerly known as ADD when I was a Junior in high school. I was originally given 10 mg to try, which didn't do anything. I was then given 20 mg to try, and that seemed to help so that became my prescription. 20 mg IR of Adderall once a day. I am currently a Junior in college so it has been about 4 years, and I have never changed my prescription because whenever I talk about my ADHD I get nervous I don't know why . For the first few years I tried to take breaks every weekend and days I didn't have a lot to get done in order to slow the build of tolerance, but the past year or so, I've had more difficulty taking breaks because on days I don't take it, I get really tired and I don't get anything done. I have noticed that without the breaks, the 20 mg once a day doesn't really do much for me anymore. Especially since IR lasts about 4- 6 hours closer to 4 for me and my day spans much longer than 4 hours. I would like to talk to my doctor about either increasing my dose, maybe taking more than one IR per day, or switching to XR, but I'm a little scared to talk to my doctor about it since it's been so long that I've had the same prescription. I feel like asking would somehow make me seem like a druggy or that he'll just say no. I'm not really sure what the best way to bring it up would be without seeming desperate. I have always planned on weaning myself off of medication at some point, and even though this is not the right time for that, I'm also nervous that a higher dosage or something will make it harder to stop taking them in the long run","I have had the same prescription of Adderall since I was diagnosed with ADHD 4 years ago .

"First of all, I know how you feel. Not quite the same reasons, but I can still relate. Your parents chose to have you. Even if they didn't plan it I have no way of knowing either way , they kept you. They chose to send your sister to school.

I know you see yourself as a financial burden, but exiting for this reason will only leave them with other kinds of burdens. My boyfriend, years ago, killed himself to help me or So he thought .

"I have a friend who I've been best friends with almost all my life. We used to be inseparable until she moved away when we were in middle school. Since then, we've seen each other infrequently but it's always like picking up where we left off. She is like a sister to me, and is a second daughter to my parents, who also love her dearly. She has dealt with more shit than anyone should in life - abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, she's abused and been the abuser in romantic relationships, just a terrible hand at times. In the last year or so, she has gone through more hardship - robbers breaking in, a bad breakup, losing jobs by her own choices, trying to get sober. Every time something has happened, she has called me, slurring and incoherent, begging me to give her permission to kill herself. I talk to her, and I try to let her feel heard and offer advice and empathy, but I really don't feel equipped to help. The calls usually devolve into her yelling at me about how my life is perfect far from it I've battle d my own mental health demons and have worked hard to stay healthy and how I couldn't possibly understand, please let her go, she wants it all to end. For the past 2- 3 years, she has not texted or called me besides to have a 1 hour phone call of me talking her down from committing suicide. I've tried to have a relationship with her besides being her emotional support, but she doesn't talk to me when things go well. I feel drained by the relationship and feel like it's totally one- sided. She never asks how I am on the calls, even. And how I am is totally wrecked after every call. I've contacted her parents for episodes in the past, but they are nearing the end of their rope due to her verbal abuse when she drinks. I've also given her the suicide hotline number and encouraged her to stay sober, practice self care, and talk to a therapist. But what else should I be doing? I just can't field these calls forever for the sake of my own mental health. She just called me last night and today I've felt incredibly stressed and distracted from my job. It takes me back to my own depression and health problems that I've had to work on with 10 years of therapy. I don't know what else I should do.

"To start, I have been friends with him for the past year, maybe a little more, though had to stay in a room with him on a course for three weeks. Just honestly, I've gotten sick of him, and not sure whether or not it's him or his ADHD and whether it's on purpose or not. I am not exaggerating at all on this, he would ask about everything I would do ""why did you leave your towels on the radiator, can't you just leave them in the dresser?""Show me your inhaler if you have asthma and want to open the window after I sprayed deodorant"" a thorough explanation of how using tissue and then putting it in your pocket spreads disease ""Karate is used not to harm people vs karate is learned to not be used""etc. Honestly, I don't understand him. Any arguements that he seems to have a phd in by watchign a video about he wins, yet any arguements that he loses he complains about me using tissue yet he coughs everywhere, advancing to debating whether or not someone would touch a dresser which was coughed on, which he then goes on to call me a ""germaphobe"", even though he started the arguement in the first place It doesn't help that he would make humming noises, talk to himself, and pretend to be Smeagol every couple minutes, either. It just annoyed me so much. Then, as I'm playing guitar, he writes a whole note explaining that he'll kill me, or break my guitar, or even the door, if they make any noise while he's asleep. Honestly he's not the strongest of people so it sounded like an empty threat, about 15 lines of threats and ""SHUT THE UP"". After that, I considered not being friends with him, and tried to ignore him as much as possible throughout the last week of the course. He went on like a detective about who stole his money, only to find the money in his used clothes. I'm reluctant to even be friends with him anymore, I had confronted him about it at least three times on the course, him always starting it again a couple days later. He'd even ask about what clothes I'd wear for the last day and say ""It's not an opera meeting"". he would wear casual clothes and I wore more of a jeans and shirt kind of outfit Main Question Is this normal in people with ADHD?

"Rant typed on a phone at 11 pm incoming ADHD is making my life miserable. Like fucking hell. High school is already damnable enough, but ADHD makes it so much worse. Every day I can feel the stress deleting my life expectancy. I take my meds, I follow the instructions, but they're never consistent. I can't ever so my stupid schoolwork at home because of how poorly everything works out. Its like the ability to do your work is managed by a ""Time Dealer"". The dealer gives neurotypical people all the time they want to do their work. He gives none to people with ADHD. Now meds when they work as they should will make this Time Dealer give you all the time you need to do your work. But how it actually turns out when I take my meds is that the Time Dealer doesn't give a shit and instead directs me to an EA tier lootbox of time. So, 65 of the time, you get the ""common reward""where only the side effects of the meds appear. 25 of the time, it works okay and it allows you to slowly trudge through your work, taking only four times as long to do it. 7.5 of the time, it works like it is supposed to and get like 2 hours of pure focus. 2 of the time it lasts about 3 hours of focus time. Finally, at 0.5 . This is the chance of the meds working as advertised. This has only happened a u handful of times for me. Every day is an overwhelming vortex of misery and frustration seeing as how I've been given a disadvantage. Of course, all the boomers think I'm just lazy. In so glad that this ""ok boomer""meme exists. Now I dont have to explain shit and then recieve a damn lecture about it. I can just give them this retort and skulk in a corner","Fuck ADHD , it sucks , school is a never ending cycle of misery , and it does n't help that the effectiveness of medication is like a fucking EA lootbox .","ADHD is making my life miserable and I don't know how to deal with it.

"So I work in a mechanical and assembly shop for Tesla. Specifically I work in a warehouse in Wilmington Delaware doing Quality Control. My job is to inspect finished products or designs and make sure everything is as it should be. And the builds are relatively small i.e. conductors, frames for what will become engines, electrical systems, etc . I'm mainly looking to make sure everything's screwed in right, labels are where they need to go, the paperwork is filled out properly, you get the idea. Well we recently just acquired some summer help for the shop andyeah. This is what this post is about. So today I get this frame for what will eventually become a coolant system in a Roadster and everything seems fine and proper untiluh oh! There's some screws missing and one of them is backwards! So I wheel it back over to who did it and point out the issue but what do I get? An attitude? This kid just rolls his eyes at me and lets out a heavy sigh and is just like ""Fine whatever""and takes it back and I leave. Like, I'm not being a dick and picking on you for no reason. I have a job to do and so do you the person who fucked it up . And then I got another screw up from another new guy who was supposed to build part of an engine that would be taken to another division. Again, labels weren't placed and it parts weren't assembled in the right spot. So again I wheel it back and show them what needs fixed and I again get an eye roll and a ""Whatever""attitude.

" Bear any grammatical errors or ordering, still in high school dont think Im that smart but still. Stigma is a horrible problem mental health faces, I can barely talk about it with people who have no clue about it because they will think Im crazy and kill someone what????! Hopefully we have a future where people are more educated about it. Life Story When I was 15 I started showing symptoms of depression, my parents took me to a therapist and got treatment in the way of pills. Tried to go back to school but couldnt due to social anxiety and missing a month of school so far. So my father decided to go to a therapy place designed to help teenagers who have mental issues. Tried that for a few months and saw some progress but mostly it was tiring and boring because we would have it for like 5 hours a day just like school. looking at me complaining about this lol After this program lasted like 5 months ended I went back to regular school and tried catching up with it. Few months pass and I feel a little bit happier but the stress comes back to me and I end up having another breakdown. I also had problems with the medicines side effects which were ear ringing for me , it was impossible to sleep at night without a fan or something that makes noise. Had decent to bad grades on some subjects so I decided to go take online schooling and have a fresh start. Still felt depressed because online schooling was new to me and I really didnt know what to do. whole life in public schools Fast forward five months later, went to China for a wedding got depressed for 1 day out of the 2 weeks I was there and basically had fun there and changed my perspective or mindset on depression and on how to tackle it. Now Im exercising right and doing my school work efficiently and have somewhat of a decent mindset. Hopefully, the days ahead are brighter than the deep suffering that is depression.

Thank you for listening, I hope all of our futures will be better than the deep past present will have. We can survive this, we can get through this, it should be treated as a disease that can be cured or helped.

"I was married and had a troubled relationships. I was young, and married. I was still immature when I had my kids. It was not a walk in the park at that age. I had kids one after another. I tried to make my marriage work, but it was a difficult time together between my husband and me. We made a lot of mistakes, it ended bad due to immaturity, and lack of education towards how to handle being married at young age. I as the mother had a bad accident that is another long story ended badly hurt in the hospital under coma. My parents found out from my address book in my purse. Once my parent drove across country to see me, they decided to take me back home with them. The surgeon advised my parents I had PTA, and I was not going to recover my memories. They advise them to be patient, and allow time to heal me. Also to not push things on me to remember them right away. I went on with my life as if nothing had happened. I dont know why I I did not remember anything about them nor my husband, and the things we had went through. My parents never told me I had kids. They kept that part of my life away from me. I dont know why they did what they did. I question them over and over again. I recently recovered my memories 15 years later.

"Throwaway, because reasons. My SO is an addict. I know the man behind the disease and I love him to bits, but his addiction is now taking a massive emotional toll on me. I'm exhausted from worry about him when he disappears. He has been threatened whilst at his dealers by randoms trying to roll him for his drugs. He falls asleep at his dealers sometimes can't wait to get home to have a hit and has been robbed on three occasions recently that I know about, most recently losing a whole weeks wages and all his ID and bankcards and his drugs too. We've had a great relationship till this addiction took hold, but he has had to move out of our home as I won't allow that shit around my family. He is living in his parents shed and sponging off them. He disappears for days on end. I am terrified I will hear form the police one day that he is in hospital after being attacked, or worse even. He has recently been making noises about trying to get clean. I meant it when I would said I would give him all the help I could whilst he goes into treatment. But I think I am just about at the point ehre I have given all I have to give. Three times in the last week he has been stoned out of his tree when I have tried to pick him up for appointments to begin treatment. All appointments that he made himself, without any prompting from me. I wish I didn't feel this way, but I can't be with him anymore. He is not ready to help himself and untill he is, there is nothing I can do for him. I feel bad, but I just can't be with him anymore. I can't cope anymore. I'm so sad.

"Hello, I am a new user to Adderall, I started sometime around April 19th - 20th can't remember exact date, but I think it was 19th. I finally saw a doctor about getting a prescription for Adderall because I realized I was losing focus on even simple things like conversations. I don't drink coffee, soda, or smoke. I take no drugs, and don't drink alcohol. In total, I have probably been missing a stimulant in my body for a long time and I should have done something much sooner I am 22 . The doctor started me on 20mg Twice a Day of Adderall. The generic brand I was given was Aurobindo from a Target CVS. The effects were amazing and everything was great. The effects and side effects diminished exponentially every day. However, after 4 days I was experience massive pain in my abdominal region. Eventually after some searching I found that Aurobindo is not only the worst brand from almost every account I read , but also has lactose monohydrate in their recipe, which was causing me to be lactose intolerant. I am not lactose intolerant, in fact, I drink a lot of milk, normally 1 - 2 gallons a week before starting Adderall now it's tons of water . However, I was once lactose intolerant because I was eating herb cream cheese every day on a sandwich for lunch. So I can be lactose intolerant if I overdo it. I saw the doctor, he lowered my dosage to be safe to 5mg Twice a Day and I threw out the pills Police drop off . I had only taken 9 of the 60. I got a new prescription this time I made sure I didn't get the Aurobindo brand. This time it was Corepharma. I heard both good and bad things about Corepharma, but mainly that it was a quick, strong high, that ended quickly. 5mg didn't do much, but it got me out of bed and forced my eyes to be awake. I was still functioning, albeit less than on the 20mg. Corepharma was actually quite good, but I needed a slightly higher dosage, so after the 1 month, I saw the doctor again. I am now on a 10mg Twice a Day prescription and every CVS I checked was out of any generic in 10mg that wasn't Aurobindo. I eventually found one that had Teva, which I had heard mixed results on, but mostly positive. I got my pills the Tuesday right after Memorial Day. The first day, the high was noticeable, as one would expect from a higher dosage. Every day since then, I feel almost as if the higher dosage is actually doing less than my previous prescription. In fact, I what pushed me to look into all of this was the fact that I was no longer having an issue with dry mouth. I rarely felt the need to drink water. I did some googling and found that Everyone who preferred Corepharma was posting that after 2015. I found a reddit post on here ","Generics are annoyingly difficult to keep straight because of many factors . I wish there was a more stable solution to my issues . Teva brand is bad , but only since 2015 when their formula changed . Actavis was acquired by Teva in 2015 , and stopped producing after being acquired . It could be related but maybe not . Corepharma is good , but is now no longer available since May 1st 2017 . Aurobindo was really terrible . ","I was prescribed Adderall 20 mg twice a day, it worked great for the first few days, but then stopped working after 4 days. I was prescribed a higher dosage, but it didn't work as well. I tried Corepharma, but I was lactose intolerant. I found a reddit post on here, which said that it was the same as Aurobindo.

I don't know what to do.","Started Adderall 20 mg twice a day, it worked great, but after 4 days the effects stopped and I felt like I wasn't getting anything out of it.

"Some thoughts I don't have any physical addiction to alcohol yet, ha . I did see a negative trend where ""incidents""would happen more easily and be more severe. I talked to a counselor, and haven't drank in 6 months as of tomorrow. I stopped to show that I could, and I haven't started because I like myself and my interactions with others better now. My mother and wife were the only people that told me they were worried about me, but I'm glad I didn't wait until more people started to express worry. I have no problem being around alcohol and other people who are drinking in moderation. I get more annoyed by sloppy or pushy drunks probably because I see myself in them . I thought about trying to moderate, but after reading that the founder of ""moderation management"", an AA alternative, killed someone drunk driving 7 years after starting MM, I decided against it. I've only been to AA twice. It was helpful for me to talk to like minded people and gain some perspective. Really helpful to see a guy say ""you sound about like I did when I was 25. I didn't get help until I was 30.""I used to think kalamata olives weren't for me until I tried some good ones. There are hundreds of different meetings, nothing to lose by trying a couple out. Good job not being resentful of the fact your family is concerned. I was always super annoyed when my mom asked me what beer I was on. Best of luck with whatever you do, and if you want my advice, keep it up for at least a week, then another then 2 more. That's how my counselor got me to a month. Each meeting I realized more about myself and my habits. Here's an example of one that I realized while drinking but could only bring myself to say once sober ""The worst thing I've done is be mean to my wife while sober so it won't seem like I'm only mean while drunk.""woof. The best thing for me was being completely honest with myself and my wife and counselor about my thoughts and feelings. I was grumpy for a month and I let them know. I was annoyed and thought we were ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater""and I told them. After so much lying and sneakiness honesty is refreshing.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. When I was first coming to grips with my anxiety, I journaled quite frequently. Not only was it a great emotional release to let my intrusive thoughts out, but it helped me get to know patterns of though. For example, I get really nervous when it comes to making eye contact in school halls. If someone I know adverts their eyes, my first inclination is to think ""oh, they hate me.""While it's still an uncomfortable experience, I realize now that whenever this intrusive thought kicks in, I recognize and name it.

"So I recently last week maybe found this subreddit and it's pretty much been an enlightenment to me because i finally found out just why the hell I'm like that and could now put words on my experiences and also stop feeling like a failure for doing absolutely nothing including skipping meals for no reason during quarantine as i lived alone.anyway . I'm a very introverted person who basically spends 95 of their time at home and i'm an avid gamer which now makes sense to me because just playing games is very nice and appealing and shields me from the dreadful perspective of doing the mountain of things i need to or could do and should be doing . I also live with my brother and mother who are both presumably not ADHD or such and most of my days include being yelled at for failing to do whatever little thing they have decided needs to be done within 2 hours. This has gotten to the point where today my mother asked me why i was like this and i handed her my phone with a useful page i found that i felt described in good details what ADHD is. She kind of skimmed through it, and told me that i had so much trouble being productive because of my computer usage and because i'm ""kind of lazy sometimes""which she replied to me when i said i used my computer so much because of ADHD . She decided that i had the symptoms because i have bad sleep i sleep 7 to 8 hours every nightnevermind the fact that my brother has nothing and actually goes to bed later than i do and don't go outside exercise gee i wonder what influences this , and she said after reading some bullshit on the internet a carefully selected part of a genuine article that she read in a section about treatment that I should stop playing video games and sleep earlier and do sports and this and that and i just wonder if she actually read what i showed her??? Or at least saw the concept of executive dysfunctionapparently it also said that meds were more harmful than helpful which i know i'm not an expert about and differ from person to person and etc but there was nothing about even just behavior coaching or whatever??? just do some fucking yoga ""like for anxiety""she said that and spend a lot of time outside and sleep from 10pm to 8am and be productive like normal people do and just don't be so lazy and try at least a little or whatever . And now i will have to deal with my family talking shit behind my back more than they already did when my brother inevitably learns about it.. Like, this is so invalidating and patronizingjust so frustrating? I have more i wish i could talk about but that would probably stray from the specific topic and just more of me ranting about my daily life and how my family makes it difficult for me and etc but my brain says no and i have incredibly important stuff i need to be doing right now which i obviously set up a reminder for 50 minutes ago only to go eat something and then spend most of the remaining 40 minutes typing this post and being interruptedthis post probably doesn't make a lot of sense and im sorry for that but at least i'm glad i managed to get some of that outand I'm pretty sure i'm not crazy and i'm pretty sure I won't be made to feel like it here so I'm really glad I found this place I even resurrected my account I never used just to post this ",i 'm Tired and frustrated of and by non - ADHD family forcing me to live their way and i really wish i did n't have to live 2 and half more months with them when i already loathe their presence every single day really going to stop now but i hope any of this makes sense and sorry for inserting so much unrelated stuff in there ,"my mom thinks i have ADHD because i'm lazy and don't go outside and do anything i need to be doing when i have a lot of important stuff to do and i can't get myself to do anything about it and now i have to deal with my family talking shit behind my back more than they already did when my brother inevitably learns about it..

" TLDR below As a college student, it's time for me to start looking for an apartment to live in next fall. I'm moving out of the dorms since my school doesn't offer housing for continuing students. My SA has really limited my ability to make friends. I asked a friend of mine if he wanted to look for a place together, and I was so happy that he said yes! But just a few days later, he told me that he ended up finding his own place. So now I need to start my search all over again Almost all of my friends have already sorted out their living arrangements for next year, so I'm pretty much out of luck when it comes to living with someone I know. Now I'm just going through Craigslist searching for affordable apartments that I can share with others. A lot of the rooms I'm liking are in apartments or houses that are being shared by grad students and PhDs. As an undergrad that is a few 5- 6 years younger than them, I actually don't mind. I'm fine with minding my own business and being social once in a while. However, I'm more worried about what those potential apartment- mates will think of me. I'm quiet and pretty awkward, but I'm not a complete shut- in. In other words, I'm just stressing out about what their expectations are of me. I'm not very interesting or social. It almost feels like I'm applying to live with them. It's somewhat hard to explain. On the other hand, I feel like I would be a pretty good house- mate, aside from not being very social talkative. I'm very very clean and respectful","I 'm looking to share an apartment house with people I do n't know mostly older and more educated than I am , but I 'm worried about their expectations of me being social , for example .","I'm looking for an apartment to live with someone I know, but I'm worried about what my potential apartment - mates will think of me.

"I am currently on Adderall XR 15mg, and it is working pretty well. The insomnia and loss of appetite have mostly subsided. The other side effects are a bit annoying but manageable. I'm annoyed by the amount of maintenance I have to do to make the medication work for me. I have to time the medicine just right. The medicine lasts 3- 4 hours before I start to feel it fade. Then it fades out until around 6 hours when I no longer feel the effects. I usually take it on my way to work so it kicks in while I'm getting settled at my desk. This means I can't use it help my morning routine. I still forgot things wallet, cell phone in the morning since I haven't taken the medication yet. The medication is worn off in the evening. Ideally I'd like to have some effects into the evening. One of the biggest pushes for me to get medicated was to help my personal relationships. Right now my colleagues are getting the benefits of my medication, but I'd much rather my GF and family get to see the improvement. I'm meeting with my doctor in a few days for a checkup.

"I've never made a post like this, but I could really use some advice. The past few weeks have been really hard on me emotionally. I've sunk into a depression and I've been taking it out on other people. I don't really know how to deal with my emotions properly. My parents were pretty unemotional and frowned upon showing anything other than happiness. As a result when I have either a hypomanic or depressive episode things become really confusing and frustrating for me. My main coping mechanism to process my emotions is to push people away and or take it out on others. The past few days I've said some things I didn't mean and tried to push my friends away. I'm starting to come out of my depression and I'm realizing that I've messed up big time. I feel absolutely horrible and I really want to apologize, but I just don't know how to. My friends know I have issues with depression, but they don't know I'm bipolar. I don't want to use me being bipolar as an excuse for my actions.

"A bit of bases first just for understanding if too long read 2nd paragraph with actual help wanted I was diagnosed with depression summer of my 16 th year after a panic attack in the middle of my 10 th grade mass communication class. Where my 5 different therapist after that said I should have been brought in much sooner like some time between 4 th and 7 th grade cause that's when I showed a 180 personality change . I am now about to turn 22 in 2 months and have been additionally diagnosed with PTSD from a sexual assault mostly verbal, but also at times physical abuse of my older sister in childhood that wasn't addressed till I was like 20 and clinical severe depression just due to the amount of time and different medication I had tried. Along the way I tried to get off medication once which resulted in a 3 month period of catatonic depression symptoms that inevitably lead to being dismissed from university. ALSO At 17yo I had a summer where I basically self medicated with alcohol my dad even asked me if I thought I was an alcoholic and I tried to drown myself in the bathroom which didn't really work because nothing was heavy enough to keep me under and I ended up sobbing while on the phone with someone who I was sure would help me which they did cause I'm still here . PLUS I am a lesbian and didn't really accept that about myself until I was 20yo and still don't 100 , but am getting there which doesn't help much. Now that I have all that out. Last year I wasn't doing very good. Probably started around May or June 2017? I had to stop seeing my psychiatrist because of a health insurance change. By the time October came around I was so bad my depression was resulting in inappropriate behavior at work like randomly crying, insinuating that a coworker was jealous of my position I swear I did not mean it this way, it was my insecurity and reaction to thinking everyone hated me, etc, but it did come out this way , and barely sleeping eating . For a whole month before that I would find myself in my bathroom crying wishing I had enough courage to actually succeed with what I tried at 17yo. In the span of the first full week of Oct I quit my job, packed up and moved back to my parents place. I tried getting therapy but am currently trying to get a new place cause the current on can only see my barely 2 times a month , get a permit to finally learn how to drive for mobility reasons not good public transit near my parents , and just trying to get back to any resemblance of ""functioning"". But I'm just not getting there. It's already January and the only thing I can say about my work is that 2 days out of a week I don't think about wishing not to exist.

And honestly I can say it was the best thing for me. I was curious to see how weed would affect me after such a long break. I had been a daily toker for almost 4 years prior to quitting. The high felt nice for about 20 minutes. My body relaxed and my mind was able to drift off. After that I just became foggy. My brain couldn't focus on anything and I just felt way too high way too soon. What really reinforced me knowing I needed to quit for good was how I felt the next day. I woke up exhausted. And nothing could change that. My head was in a fog all day and I felt like I do when coming down from a high ALL DAY. Not even coffee or a 4 hour nap could change that. I have never felt that way before. It was by far the worst hangover from weed I've ever had. My entire day was wasted and what for? The thrill of being high for a few hours? At this point it's just not worth it to me anymore. I guess I just wanted to share for anyone who is feeling like they can't do it. Remember the clarity sobriety gives you. I wouldn't change that for the world. I never want to feel that disconnected again. Not after knowing how good I feel as sober me. You can do it! It will only make you feel worse in the end,"Relapsed after 2 months , felt like shit for an entire day after that .

"I recently had a very similar experience with my girlfriend. I just got out of the military and had a whole lot of life changes. My girlfriend had just moved in with me and the relationship was still fun and exciting because of the new changes. Things started to level out and the stimulation started to diminish a bit normal for a long term relationship .

"I dont know if this flair makes any sense at all to he honest but I have to rant real quickly. I love reading. I think it's so much fun. But I'm really bad at it.

I recently started Miss Peregrines home for peculiar children but after finding out that there are tons of books in that series I dont have the energy to finish it. And, Harry Potter especially is such a great story. I love it not JK Rowling, just the stories and I wanna be able to talk to people about and feel like a ""real""fan of the series but so many people think that unless you've read all of the books you're not.

"This is not a ""oh no woe is me""post or a ""pls redirect me to the national suicide hotline""post. Instead, this is going to be a hopefully constructive post which most people here will be able to contribute to or get something out of. How are you supposed to make life worth living when you're not neurotypical? It seems like a bit of a raw deal. If you are a man like roughly four fifths of people on the spectrum , not exceptionally athletic motor skills down the drain , not exceptionally intelligent you might have flown through high school with little effort and gotten into a degree mill university but it ends there, you aren't going to be publishing papers on high- level mathematics or molecular biology for a living , not exceptionally socially competent, not exceptionally skilled and not exceptionally motivated, nobody is going to go out of their way to accommodate you. Nobody is going to headhunt you for some natural strength you have or remember your name when they're looking for a certain type of person, it simply isn't happening. For better or worse, you're on your own. Being on your own in this situation isn't really being ""on your own"". When you're on your own you aren't an island, you are surrounded by people and even though you suck at it will be forced to interact with them for basic necessities. It's only natural that, because they're providing you basic necessities, you are expected to give them something in return. Get a job, earn a wage and so on. What's ""on your own""about it is that you're expected to become a useful person on your own without anybody else's support support from other people is something you earn . Because so many people are climbing on top of each other to get access to what is generally considered to be basic necessities in a first world country all of which requires a wage , the people who provide you with a job are free to pick and choose who gets hired and who doesn't. You are disposable, any minor flaw you might have not even a neurological disorder can get you thrown on the scrapheap very easily. From my anecdotal experience this seems to be especially true if you are a young man, but maybe I'm wrong and nobody in particular is treated as especially disposable. Assuming you manage to find success in the job market, which requires a lot of ""networking""this is pretty hard, nobody is going to tell you who to talk to and how either because they don't care about your interests and dealing with your workplace now ""team- oriented""and with a shoddily taped- on human face instead of just a storefront for a face , what are you going to be other than a worker bee? Do you have friends in real life, or even online friends? Even a lot of NT middle- aged and above people are at risk of becoming drones who are completely asocial outside of work, so what do you think is going to happen to you? At best, you go to work and then get home exhausted to use the internet until you fall asleep, seeing friends only occasionally or only online. People around you don't care that you exist, you will only be called upon when you are useful for something. How and why would they ever make a genuine connection with you, a literal social retard, in any way more than tolerating you? Do you think you're going to have a great circle of friends? I'd wager one person here will say they do and everyone else will go ""oh, this isn't so bad then""not realising that person is the exception and not the RULE. Who wants to be buddies with an autist, especially when they're not stuck with you and are surrounded by people who don't share your major brain structure- induced flaws? Instead of just bitching and whining about problems, two important questions should be asked here. You have probably heard some version of the sentence ""your brain is wired differently, there are places you can work and people you can hang around that will make sense to you""come out of somebody's mouth. Where are there places and people? What kinds of jobs are aspie- friendly? I am currently specialising in studying forms of clerical work like accounting, which are pretty straightforward and easy to create mental flowcharts with compared to some other bullshit- filled fields of work. Would you consider accounting to be an aspie- friendly job, and what other fields of work would you say are suited to somebody on the spectrum? Also, where do you meet people? It's hard enough for neurotypicals past a certain point ","summary , what can an aspie do to - have success in the workplace - have genuine friends in real life - have fulfilling hobbies - become successful and self - sufficient in general - have a family - build a legacy in ways that do not involve reproducing And in general , - make life bearable and worth living - make life purposeful - achieve above and beyond what is expected of you by other people with little to no help so you can move on to fulfilling things","I'm not neurotypical, I'm on the spectrum, I don't have a job, I have no friends, I can't find a way to make friends, and I am on the verge of suicide. How do I make my life worth living when I've been forced to live on my own for most of my adult life?","I'm sorry if this isn't the best place for this kind of post, but I'm not sure where else to post it. I don't know if I should post it here or the national suicide hotline or if it's better suited to a sub like r aspie_advice.","Autistics are treated as disposable in the workplace because they don't fit into the field of accounting which requires a wage and which pays the bills. Autistics are expected to give the people who provide them with a job something in return for their labour, which is something they are legally required to do because they're hired by the government. This means Autistics have no friends, no social life, no hobbies, no talents, no skills, no interests, no dreams, no hopes, no aspirations, no goals, no desires, nothing.

"Throw away account here, for obv reasons. So I did ok in high school and college. Decided I wanted to go to med school and was hyper focused on finishing the pre- reqs as a post bacc, and did really well in those. But after med school started I just could NOT get it together. Therapist suggested I go in for the battery of tests for ADD, which I paid 300 to do btw . That's when I was officially diagnosed. Was told that people who have ""excellent coping mechanisms""will often find them overwhelmed by grad school. At time of dx had failed a couple med school classes, even repeated a year which they charge you for . Kept pushing myself for longer than I should bc I felt trapped knowing I would NEVER pay off this debt if I didn't finish. Told a relative about the dx and she said, ""just don't let them put you on that medicine that messes with your brain.' Got a similar statement from another relative that I trust. Well got to the point that I was suicidally depressed with how miserable it was making me. Basically had a nervous breakdown. Ultimately I withdrew but now struggling even more. I completed 2 years 3 since I had to repeat , hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and med school US school won't even give credit for a master's degree. I don't know what to do. I pretty much ghosted all of my med school classmates out of shame really. Makes me feel so stupid when I see them posting about their residencies and successes and I currently have a job making 14 an hour bc I couldn't cut it. Med school culture is about never quitting and that if you can't keep pushing yourself then you are weak, etc etc. And that shit is embedded in my brain. Stopped going to church bc after 2 years of my pastor calling me ""doctor""in front of everyone there, again I'm too ashamed to face them. I already know the ""church folk""are whispering bc I just try to avoid the subject when it comes up. And hate to admit it but there are some ppl at church who will just be THRILLED with this failure. Had been working with a great therapist who has now retired and most recent therapist wasn't even pronouncing my name right after 3 months . I am LOW, guys. Credit card got charged off last week because I was late too many times. If I didn't have a kid I probably would have killed myself. Oh yeah, started med school as second career in my 30s trying to make a better life for us and feel like I have only made things 10000 times worse. Now I don't even have life insurance so I feel like I'm worth nothing alive or dead. Really don't know where to even start",Was dx as med student . Could n't finish med school .

"Im 16. I don't think thats super important for context, but it might help with perspective. Consistently, from about since I was 10 now, family trips just put me in the worst mental state. Ive always just chalked it up to being in the same space with people I dont particularly enjoy for so long without a break would naturally make me want to claw my eyes out, but for about a year now Ive been thinking that its not normal. In recent trips and even sometimes in normal life Ive been often getting consistent intrusive thoughts telling me to injure people, or myself, especially centered around my sister. In the most current trip the one that is happening at the moment Ive been almost constantly thinking of self- harm and suicide, even going to the extent of scratching my arms to get the thoughts to go away. My mind isnt normally that focused on such things, more often that not Im able to stop myself from going too far and distract myself . I also have terrible mood swings that never last more than a couple hours on either end of the emotion spectrum. The most horrible thing of all is that when I get like this, Im the worst possible person to be around because I have so much pent up anger and sadness inside me and no outlet to let it out because Im around my family All The Time . This makes my parents dislike my presence, which is fair, and then theyre in a bad mood because of me and this affects everyone present. Im ruining whats supposed to be a fun trip for everyone and I dont know how to stop it, and I just spiral downwards until what happens every time is that the vacation ends, I hole up in my room for as long as possible, and when Im forced to come out Im some sort of normal.

"As a fellow guy who does guys, drinking concentrated coffee helped before I started medication since my focus was always better when overly stimulated. Back then I was more of a top and I would usually just keep going until my guy came. Since I struggled to climax, but the stamina was ridiculous from trailing off mentally, it was also more helpful if having a niche or kink preference. Like kissing or oral was my go- to to force myself to get off. I think the guys appreciated it too since it seemed like I was more into them even though I did it for selfish reasons, lol. You can also consider power bottoming. I prefer that now because a majority of the time I like being in charge. Focusing on getting your own body off without your meat stick requires more focus, positioning, and effort than the other way around. Especially if youre trying to get both you and your guy off. Lastly, regularly working out, going on a run, or doing something that requires a lot of energy prior to sex could be helpful. My body builds up A LOT of energy, so having an outlet to exude some of it is both healthy and releases feel- good chemicals, particularly with ADDs dopamine deficiency, if done regularly. Generally, my focus is better a few hours post- workout and sometimes my libido would skyrocket after a really good workout that I occasionally crave sex like an animal in heat. Considering my body is releasing a lot of dopamine at that time, my body wants more of it and Im going to give my brain what it wants by keeping the momentum going through intense, sweaty, salty, sex",Pretty much anything where I am passive or just going through the motions is counterproductive .

"So here's the deal. I've always thought of depression as being just sad all the time and crying a lot, but this subreddit and further research have gotten me to a point of better understanding. I'm not sad everyday. Certainly there are moments when I get upset and want to cry, but that's normal. I feel like I've felt that way a lot when I was a kid but I don't anymore. Now I don't get sad unusually often, and even if I want to I don't cry just because for some reason I can't, and I don't wake up dreading every day now. But now I do feel kind of emotionally dead inside. My mood changes- for some months at a time I'm ""normal""and things make me happy. Not like a bipolar ""high, ""just what I perceive being normal to feel like. But other months I get into an inescapable negative mindset where I doubt myself and think people don't like me. I wouldn't say I ""hate""myself, but I do feel disgusted with my appearance or personality and such. Sometimes I get so caught up in that mindset that I just want to cry and give up. People tell me to cheer up and it's like, no, I can't. it's not possible. I know nothing's wrong in my life but I'm unhappy. So I guess these months are classic depression symptoms. Other months I just feel kind of emotionless. I'm not sad but I just feel apathetic, cynical, and isolated and irritated with humanity. There are a few constants. One, that evil doom cycle of loneliness when alone and total lack of energy and willingness to socialize around other people. Two, I rarely smile and people call me out on that all the time. I'm not sad or upset, I just don't feel like there's any reason to smile. Smiling is foreign to me. Three, I have been diagnosed with general anxiety, and I know there are parallels in brain chemistry between anxiety and depression. Four, I'm very disorganized and have problems paying attention, starting to do things I need to do, and I'm a really bad procrastinator. So","I 'm not sad or feel hopeless all the time , and sometimes I can be quite happy for months at a time , but I do have other symptoms .

"Firstly, my condolences for your dad. I know it's been a few years but it's clear that his absence is affecting you so much now. I relate hard to your post. I went to my Psychiatrist because of depression anxiety, and got diagnosed with ADHD during our sessions. After a few months of being on antidepressants, since I wasn't improving much, he started me on Ritalin. I must say that the difference is outstanding. Since then my Psychiatrist made the conclusion that my depression anxiety is mainly being exacerbated by my poor performance in school. Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain, while antidepressants seek to correct this, they can't do anything if what causes the chemical imbalance in the first place remains. With the lessened triggers of my depression, that's when my antidepressants became more effective",Depression anxiety and ADHD are not directly related but they interact with each other that can make it worse or better .,"I was diagnosed with ADHD after a few months of being on Ritalin, and now I'm on it.

"Hey! It's a complicated question, as we are all individuals at different stages. The short answer is sometimes no, but often, yes. Personally, I don't believe people with mental illness need an incentive to get better, and agree with Rogerian theory about the actualising tendency put simply, we all have an innate drive towards growth in the right conditions . We would never accuse people with cancer of essentially not trying hard enough to heal. I would say that there is a huge difference between enabling someone who is stuck in a place of learned helplessness, and helping someone who is struggling to reframe their experience so that they can move forward. For example, it is unlikely to be helpful for a therapist to ask someone with depression to see the positives of staying in bed all day every day - ""You get to watch so much Netflix! ""But it might be very helpful for the therapist to work with that same person to see that how they experience their depression can be changed. Sometimes self care might mean staying in bed, and that's ok. Choosing self- acceptance ""Ok, this is what I need right now, let's see how I feel in an hour""is actually likely to result in a more positive impact on a difficult day than using the experience as fuel for negative self- talk ""I'm useless, no point trying to get up now, I've ruined another day. Why am I like this?""That's a very simplistic example, but another one would be recent developments in treating schizophrenia with talking therapies, something that used to be seen as not possible, where people are starting a dialogue with their voices. Rather than the goal being to eradicate that person's experience, the focus is on exploring that experience to help that person get to a point of functioning better. Eleanor Longden's TED talk 14 mins on her journey with hearing voices is well worth a watch ","Fixing ""people based on their diagnosis is less important to me as a therapist than working with people as individuals to get to a place where they feel better .","Yes, it's important to help people with mental illness get better, but there is no one - size - fits - all solution. It's a matter of working with the individual to help them see that they can get better.","Yes, yes, it can be helpful to help someone who is struggling to cope with their experience, but it isn't helpful to enable that person to stay in bed all day.","Yes, sometimes no, but often yes. It's important to work with people to help them change their experience of the world, not to enable them to ""fix ""it, but to help that experience reframe it in a way that helps that person get to a point of functioning better.

"I've fallen into a nasty cycle that I'm honestly not sure how to fix anymore. You can pretty much put any word you want in front of addict and it would be applicable. Alcohol, weed, opiates, stimulants, gabapenoids, benzo's, gambling, adrenaline, ect. I've had physical addictions to all of them where it applies, and broken those addictions in secret. Despite this, I always fall back, especially to stimulants and opiates. Stimulants because I live an unrealistically demanding life, and opiates because i'm actively watching everyone I care about, and all of my aspirations being destroyed while suffering from really severe ptsd. I was everyone's rock, and always showed up when people needed me. This aspect of my life eventually consumed everything else. My academics fell apart. I stopped having time to intern in labs, and then with covid and not having a degree, my family refusing to teach me to drive while actively harassing and attacking me for trying to learn elsewhere, getting a job is difficult. I started to take on serious debt from school and other expenses. These same people who's issues imposed onto my life are no longer there when I need advice or even someone to talk to. The worst part is I'm 21 now. I should be way too old to be complaining about parents or family, however the older I get, the more I feel this very strange chokehold on me they have, and the more I see how handicapped I've been. I literally can't exit the house without being pulled aside and essentially ambushed for information, and that has gone on even back when I was a complete straight edge. I wasn't taught or shown how to be a stable adult. The people I grew up around weren't either, and that is why half joined the army and the other half are working the street. I had no example, but I don't want to live this shitty meaningless life just going with the flow and doing nothing toward my goals. These same family members all tell me to sober up, telling me I should just figure it out without drugs, however they fail to realize, and I myself was in denial that I want to be high. I don't want to sit in an unstable, volatile situation sober with wings clipped. I want guidance on how to get out of that so I can go back to feeling content sober. Do you guys have any ideas?

"I've struggled with untreated, unmanaged ADHD for years and I have gotten to the point where I can no longer cope with the stress and the frustration it causes me without treatment and medication. I've known I've had ADHD for years, but resisted getting treatment for it because I thought I could overcome the symptoms on my own. I've been reading a number of articles about ADHD over the past couple week, and tonight I read something that really struck a nerve with me. It described me perfectly. I thought I understood ADHD pretty well before I read this article, but now I realize there was much I didn't know. I'm paraphrasing here but the article described ADHD as a problem relating to how the brain takes in stimulation. Basically the brain cannot regulate its responses to outside stimulation properly. Those of us with ADHD have a tendency to constantly seek out more stimulation, but then our brains ""crash""when we are overstimulated. I'm almost breaking down in tears at the moment because this describes me so perfectly. It now makes sense why I often crave high levels of stimulation, and am always trying to distract myself when getting stuff done. It also describes how at other times the ADHD brain cannot handle excess stimulation. It mentioned avoiding department stores at times for this reason and I was stunned because I have definitely experienced that. I normally love shopping but there definitely have been times when the lights and the crowds were giving me massive anxiety. I personally go back and forth between craving lots of stimulation and needing to isolate myself in my room away from everything. I NEVER understood it, until now. It's funny because so many other descriptions of ADHD talk about us like we are all incredibly creative, off beat, nonconformist personalities. I never felt like that described me at all. I always have felt like deep down I am a very rational, practical person but for whatever reason I have had issues ""going with the flow""and I NEVER understood it until I realized that it has to do with how sensitive I am to stimulation. I want to cry because I feel like I understand now why I get easily bent out of shape over the smallest things, why I easily zone out in group conversations, why I come home from work sometimes and have to pass out in bed, and why I struggle not to overeat or overspend money. I'm wondering if this describes anyone else's experiences with ADHD because I feel like despite all the pain I've gone through lately, I finally feel some clarity","Read an article explaining out ADHD makes people sensitive to stimulation , and leaves people feeling like they are either craving more stimulation or they are burned out from being overstimulated .

"So I stumbled across a kind of a self improvement blog while I was still in college dealing with some personal issues, depression etc. Meant to bookmark it and now a few months on, I'm out of college amp I'm trying to change my lifestyle a bit, and this article spoke to me on many levels about doing that, it really was just great. It spoke of how I'm a character that feels strongly about certain things but too weak nice in real situations, as part of a demographic with a good skillset and mind but not brave enough to tackle the real world, things like that. Also some specifics on relationship issues related to the afformentioned traits. Authors language seemed reasonably audacious and free, but more specifically it was refreshingly honest, somewhat cutting but straight to the core, very detailed and reflective on a certain character type- it actually accurately defined certain bad traits, not generally positive and nonspecific like tinybuddha, etc but still focused on the problem solving aspect. It also provided some other links at the end to either other parts of their website, some discussion board aimed at young adult males in the same life solving situation, which is another reason I would like to find this out Although I could be mistaking that bit because I was flicking through other websites too lol. It did mention how it had gathered over 20- 30 million views amp shares, making it one of the top read blogs in 2012 13 but I've been lobbing in keywords like I did the 1st time round and no cigar.

"So I encountered this article a couple years ago when I was getting super depressed by all the literature talking about ""bipolar bad this, bipolar bad that, disabled this, stupid that""and decided to search for reasons to feel like it's anything other than a curse. Someone over on r bipolar reminded me of it when they were talking about how if they knew they were bipolar they wouldn't have gotten married or had kids. It was a bit of a trigger to me. Like that my disorder makes my life not worth living. That hurt. Maybe it's the same logic I used in middle school when I'd shout out ""loser power""and express pride in something society tells me to be ashamed of. Maybe it's not a rational thought train that gets me to this conclusion, but I try to tell myself I'd rather be this way. That since I can't be anything else, I should get myself not to want to be anything else. That, hey I have a heart and a moral compass that might not be anywhere near as strong had I not felt such pain. That it's better than just being depressed all the time. That I get to experience highs without drugs and experience bouts of endless energy. That when things feel darkest, comforts can be so much more comforting. Consider this if you tell yourself you don't want to have kids because they'll be like you, what does that say about your relationship with yourself? It's one thing not to want kids because you don't think you could be responsible, or because they'd annoy the fuck out of you or make you miserable, but isn't it depressing to think your own life would be better off not having happened? I don't want to get into whether or not you want to have kids or the ethics of having kids with a risk of inherited mental illness we've had that conversation here before see here ","for those too depressed to read it disinterested busy lethargic gtConclusions Bipolar disorder is associated with the positive psychological traits of spirituality , empathy , creativity , realism , and resilience .

It also made me realize that maybe I don't want to be this way, but I try to tell myself it's better than being depressed all the time. It's hard not to feel like life would be better if I wasn't bipolar, but then again maybe it wouldn't have been worth living if I weren't.

"I have struggled with anxiety my whole life but I've only received proper medical care for it in the last year. This last year I've been on low doses of the following Prozac and Buspirone daily and Propanolol and Xanax as needed. However, after about a year I'm still having intense anxiety and my doctor switched me to 10 mg of Lexapro last week. It's made me a zombie but, more disconcertingly, I've been intensively thinking about cutting myself. I have never cut myself or any other similar form of self- harm but I'm literally sitting here with a knife and gauze next to me ready to begin cutting. I don't know what to do.

"I have posted here before but I am posting again as I am having a hard time coping with my depression. My diagnosis is anxiety with depression and as you already know, its a tough thing to deal with. This holiday season has triggered my depression to another level. I have an abusive family that consists of a narcissistic mother and condescending grandmother. My mother has called me a mistake, loser, failure, you name it, she said it. My grandmother has told me numerous times that Id be better off dead. This probably caused a lot of self- loathing with myself. The worst thing that was ever said to me however was my mother telling me that my deceased grandfather only saw the potential in her and not me. He passed away in November 2017 and I feel like to this day, he was the only person who truly loved me. Ive only seen my biological deadbeat father a handful of times and he did more harm than good. For some reason, I refused to go to school one day in the 5th grade and he held my arm hard and shoved me in front of the classroom and yelled at me. He told me to apologize to the classroom for reasons I dont know to this day. Ive dealt with many traumatizing events. I dropped out of the 8th grade due to my diagnoses but obtained my HSE in June 2018 I go to college in the Fall of 2019 currently taking a gap year . In August 2018, I obtained my first job working at a retail store. I do slave work for minimum wage. My mother is low- middle class while my grandmother lives off a pension so I am not in a financially privileged situation. We reside in NYC. This started on a Thanksgiving late- night as I worked a late shift. I saw happy families shopping and smiling and right away, my mind wondered, why cant I have that? Ever since that day, my depression has gotten worse as I compare my situations with others who have it better than me. Weeks later, someone walked in and bought 4 TVs and that someone and her friend drove away in a new BMW. In that moment, I wanted to break down in cry. Look at me doing slave work while people around my age they couldnt be older than 23 , enjoy themselves in luxury. I am a materialistic person but I guess that doesnt surprise me as I dont have a loving family. Whenever I think about my future, I dream of having materialistic things much more than having a family. I cant even go on Instagram without comparing myself to a model that has the perfect body through surgery or a person having more materialistic things than me. I know its a problem but I cant help it. I feel lonely in this world as no one cares about me or loves me but I dont even love myself. The only think I can look forward to is college its my only way out. My mother is going to help me through college but she doesnt know that when I finish undergrad, Im going no contact for good. Thats still 4 years I have left to deal with her bullshit. I have a psychologist once a week and psychiatrist once a month. I do go to therapy but I havent explained my increased depression in a vivid manner I will next time I see them. All in all, I just wish my life wasnt fucked up. Im not suicidal. I just think why I had to be put with this shitty family",Depression has worsened since Thanksgiving as I work in retail and see happy families shopping while I am told how much of a burden I am .

"Hi guys, first time posting here first time finding this sub- reddit as well . I'm male, 28, been diagnosed with SAD GAD about 10 years ago and tried various things to help cope with it. The only 3 times in my life where I've found myself to have ZERO anxiety was when the 2 times that I took shrooms with some booze and the first and only time where I tried Speed. On those 3 occasions I felt like a normal human being! No worries about whatever, just having fun and enjoying myself, not giving a fuck about what others thing. Normally I'd be antisocial in a group until I'm comfortable with them usually takes a while but on those times it didn't matter who was around, I would carry my own and it was great! My quality of life would greatly be increased if I could live in those moments again but only everyday. I'm going to the doc in a few days to be put back on some meds again, it's at the point where it affects my job and willingness to just go outside even if it's just for a walk. I hate it. I have done therapy before, I know the mental triggers where the anxiety kicks in and I tell myself that it's nothing to worry about but when it comes to that my body had already reacted and it's too late. I get the shakes, I can't think straight, can't communicate properly or clearly and etc. So does anyone know of medicine where it replicates the anxiety removal effects of said shrooms and speed without the trippyness? Although I wouldn't say no if there was a bit of wheeeeeeee involved ","Always had big anxiety problems , tried some trippy drugs and the anxiety stopped during those times and was immensely social . Need to replicate said effect with a prescription without tripping balls ie remain functional for work . UPDATE Dr prescribed Zoloft to begin with . Small doses of 25 mg a day for the first week , 50 mg for the second week followed by 100 mg a day for the rest . Another checkup is scheduled in 3 weeks to see if the meds have also helped with the ADD since a lot of the symptoms overlap for both conditions .","I've tried shrooms, speed and alcohol and haven't been able to get rid of my anxiety and I'm looking for medicine that replicates the anxiety removal effects of shrooms and speed without the trippyness.","I've had anxiety for 10 years, only 3 times in my life where I haven't had anxiety was when I took shrooms and speed.

"So today is my second day on Adderall, and my boyfriend called me to see how I did today. I haven't talked to him much since I got my prescription since he's out of town for work and has been busy the past few days. I was trying to describe the changes I felt, and I mentioned that it seemed to be helping my anxiety too, and he said ""yeah just from the few minutes we've been on the phone you sound a lot different"". I knew he meant good different and not bad different, but I still asked him to clarify. He said basically I sounded a lot more calm, confident, and it didn't sound like I was struggling to find the words for what I wanted to say. I just started crying good tears of course and I started to realize that this is going to change my life. And for the person who knows me best, and who has seen me struggle with mental health since I've known him, to see such a difference after a ten minute phone call is amazing. I know there is still a long way to go. I know I could need to change dosage or medicine, and learn new techniques and coping skills.

I think about my own perception and life, and how a random stranger is living their own life and seeing it from their eyes, and I just cannot fathom that. The thing that's different for me is that I feel this way because I just can't believe how intricate and complex life is. It's like because I'm capable of thinking such complex ideas, that it just seems like it can't be real. Life is so real, how can it be real? It's the same for memories, where it's just so crazy that I experienced certain things like a concert, that it just doesn't seem possible. I'm not entirely sure if I can quite identity with some of the stories on here, because like I said, I feel this way because all of this just doesn't seem possible. I also sometimes think that I just feel this way because I'm older and while I'm still sheltered, I'm more in the real world. I just wasn't capable of these thoughts when I was younger because life was so structured. Now, the future isn't set in stone and everything just seems so unknown. I just don't know if I feel this way because of this period in my life or if there is something wrong","I 've never thought so intensely about how I 'm living and experiencing life . No one else is experiencing life the way I am , yet everyone else is real and alive .

"A few weeks ago I read a post in IAmA about someone who was in an abusive relationship. I am twenty two and never realized just because you are in a relationship doesn't mean rape can't happen. I was in a physically, emotionally and now I realize sexually abusive relationship when I was 14- 16. It took a toll on me, to say the least. Now I am happily married but slipping back into depression. I have nightmares nearly every night about my ex- boyfriend. I mumble, make noises and thrash around a bit and it wakes up my husband. He has to hold me really tight until I wake up, I start crying and he has to comfort me.

I don't know how to tell him about it. He knows about my abusive ex- boyfriend, but only to a certain extent. He also knows I use self injury as a way to cope and have been lately because I am so depressed and feel like the past is going to ruin my marriage. My ex- boyfriend also made me develop a fucked up image of food and I struggle to maintain a healthy weight, which is also frustrating for my husband. He is trying to be supportive and help me gain weight but it's really hard to explain why I'm like that. I hate to sound like a complete basket case, but normally I am fine.

"Alright, I've always had problems with depression mainly brought on by myself due to methamphetamine use starting in sophomore year in high school. I have moved away and am actually clean off the shit now about 6 months. I am 25 last week and have nothing to show for these past 25 years except for more good times had than most people have in a lifetime. I have graduated high school, I have some how avoided ever getting arrested for anything as an adult. This past year, all I have been doing is distributing and trafficking marijuana from California but haven't been saving for shit because I honestly thought I'd be dead by now. I decided I was gonna off myself when breaking bad was over but they saved my life by extending the season out and now, well, I have a decision to make. I have 5k in hundreds, and that's everything I have except for all my toys and instruments I've been saving.

"Hi all, Im feeling very anxious and strange right now. I think I know why, Im absolutely exhausted. Ive been battling anxiety for the past 10 or so years just for background. My dog had a litter of puppies Friday night, we my partner and I thought she was going in to labour on Thursday night, so we didnt sleep very well Thursday. Then all Friday morning I was really anxious, I was worried about my dog and whether shed be okay, and whether the pups would all be okay. She finished giving birth around 11pm on Friday, with minor complications during the birth and a scare at one point when she started bleeding quite a bit after I had to pull a puppy out of her that was stuck. Im happy to say that shes well now and has settled in to being a mum nicely! On Friday I got to bed about 4am, after letting my partner get some sleep, and then was up after about 2 hours - we cant let the dog or pups out of our sight at the moment as she may sit on one etc and we need to be there to chaperone. Saturday I wasnt too bad, was exhausted, emotionally and physically, but I managed to get a cat nap in at lunch time and my partner and I took it in turns watching her all night, getting little 2 hour sleeps in each and then swapping. Today I just feel awful. I feel so exhausted, the most tired I have ever felt in my life, and when Im tired it usually makes my anxiety a lot worse, or at least its a lot harder to reassure myself that Ill be okay.

"Hi everyone. I struggled with a restrictive ED three years ago, made full physical recovery in the meantime, but basically, this summer, I'm finding myself in a relapse. I've lost more weight than I intended, and unfortunately, I like it, and I want to keep going. Intuitively, I know this is toxic thinking. I know this is my ED brain trying to win over my real brain, so I wonder why I can't just stop. I went on vacation a few weeks ago with my lovely boyfriend and it was so nerve- wracking for me. If we were going to have a meal out, that's all I would generally allow myself to have because I was so anxious not knowing the calorie counts of those meals. Tomorrow, we are celebrating our one year anniversary, and of course having a meal out will be involved, so I've already figured out a way I can keep myself from eating hardly anything the rest of the day. Lately I've been getting worse, intentionally skipping meals, or replacing meals with very light snacks to create a larger deficit. I know this is bad. I know this is harmful. I hate fighting the hunger, going to bed feeling like I have zero energy left in me, feeling so anxious about anything food related. My body image is so damaged that I feel like the only way I can like it is if I become underweight again, but even I know this won't be true. There's never a light at the end of the tunnel with an ED. I just want to genuinely enjoy my anniversary with my sweetheart without being so anxious and guilty about eating, or having to worry about starving myself to make up for that one outing. He knows about what's been going on and is trying his best to be very helpful, but I can tell at this point that he's getting frustrated that it just seems like a dead end because I'm so hesitant to take his advice when he simply just tells me to eat more. Why is it so hard for me to do that? Is that how bad this has gotten? I just don't know what I can do. I want to have a better body image and I want to stop being so obsessive my food intake and weight, but I feel like I can't have both of those at the same time. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this post other than just to rant, but maybe someone can give me some insight that I can't see myself","I am so sick of this ED mindset but I do n't know how to quit , but I feel like it 's getting the way of enjoying my life and could ruin my relationship if I do n't get this under control .

"Hi, first time poster. I've lurked a bit. Like two months ago I managed to somehow get a job at a place I considered my dream company right in the city where my long distance boyfriend lives. So I made the move, poured what little money and energy I had into making the move. I was excited, things felt like they were going my way. At this point my mental health was A .

I don't feel like the full gravity of the situation is being taken seriously by him or others, but it is hitting me hard. I don't often get a lot of time with him anymore as he started a new job with unusual hours so I really am on my own a lot. I'm struggling with verbalising my feelings and feeling confident about my ability to get a job and get my life back on track. I am also scared, because I think my learning disability albeit a minor one was a contributor to me losing my job.. and so my self worth has plummeted and I've never wanted to be normal so much in my life.

"So I haven't had insurance since June thanks to the incompetent jackasses at one of my previous employers. They had a great healthcare plan that I kept after leaving through COBRA, then they ""forgot""to tell me that their rates nearly tripled in the beginning of 2015, then once they ""remembered""they emailed saying that they regret the mistake and I could either pay back the 4 months a couple grand and start paying the higher rate, or leave. I told them to eat shit and apparently that isn't a ""qualifying life event""so I've been waiting until Nov to get insurance again. I used to take Vyvanse but after I lost coverage it went up to 250 because I had to pay retail. I asked my doctor to switch me to Adderall until I was able to get insurance that could cover it again. I went from 60mg Vyvanse to 30mg Adderall non- XR and it's definitely not enough, but whatever, that point is moot. I'm not happy the doctor I've had since I moved to this area, he's a child psychiatrist like my last one, which is fine and my appointments consist of a 5 minute conversation followed by him filling out 3 months worth of prescriptions. He's not monitoring how I'm doing or suggesting anything helpful, and I feel like there's so much more I could be doing to live a much better life. Nutrition, therapies like Neurofeedback, etc. I'd at least like to know what is available and could help along with my medication. I'm getting carried away. Anyhow, I'm looking on the marketplace for insurance plans and aside from Prescription costs, I'm not sure what to look for. They list mental and behavior health as a separate category and the only ones that are covered before a super high deductible are in- network only and when I checked, all of their psychiatrists are rehab therapists and similar .

"Hi - I'm a long time lurker 33M to Reddit who has long been a passive consumer, but never had any material to share inclination to participate. I feel like my problem of depression isn't on any single dimension, so I don't know how to paint the picture, without providing some details. If I could express in a simpler way, I'd love to, but I've never felt really myself in a non- depressed state I could point to as what I'd like to get back to. So, a bit about my situation I'm now in my early thirties- here's a bit of context Physically - I was a scrawny kid, my family moved a bit during early elementary years - I tended to be weak at athletics and sports, and had my fair share of humiliations in anything related to physical education. At best, I could hope for my inability to go unnoticed and just be present. In general, I seem to have been a slow learner here, who had a lot of trouble with very fundamental skills in athletics which closed off lot of opportunities for sports. That part of my life pretty much went on hold after I completed my Grade 9 physical education classes. In university, I started to get into my present pattern of going to the gym for weight training and cardio. I periodically have tried to take up new things like Karate, group fitness classes bootcamps, etc, but due to my lack of development and practice, I usually found myself underperforming compared to the group and I find it hard to be able to sustain the effort to get to the point of mere mediocrity. At the present, I go to the gym but it is kind of just me going through the motions, with limited gains, as I have no meaningful goals to work towards. At present, I'm lean- average- I consider myself to be in OK shape, not great, but not getting in the way of other basic aspects of life. However, I do think that my lack of any interests in cool physical activities does hurt my prospects with dating- more on that further below. Family - My Father has a lot of his own mind- set issues from his own shitty childhood. He didn't really ever understand me, and dealing with him was always on his terms. He occasionally tried to get me to do new things, but almost always it was a forced effort because he was in control of things, or from standpoint of ""you'll regret it if you don't get into this"", as opposed to sharing something intrinsically fun or interesting. People who don't know him find him to be amusing charming, but I feel like the more people see of him, the less they like. My Mom is polite nice, but has been a virtual non- entity in my emotional life. My sister is several years older than me, she didn't really have much time for a little brother, so we didn't really talk much until much later as adults who grew up in that household. I visit for xmas each year, predominantly out of guilt respect for the people who tried to raise me. Hobbies - Computer games, BBSes and Video games early on were pretty fascinating addictive for me. My parents at times pushed me to play on them less than I did, and weren't supportive of my interest in taking up programming, so my use was primarily on gaming until high school. As a kid, Legos were the main toy I liked, which my father forced me to get rid of them when I turned 13. I rode my bike as a kid student, as I didn't have money for a car. In late elementary school there was some reading challenge which I took up, devouring plenty of classic fiction, which is still something I enjoy from time to time, when I can find an author I enjoy harder than as a kid discovering Tolkein or Asimov for the first time . As an adult who has seen so many generations of the same variety of game, it's hard not to get a slowly diminishing satisfaction from this hobby habit. I don't think there's anything wrong with gaming, but I feel like I overdo it to make up for a persistent vacuum of other things in my life. School Job Finances- I had long been into computers tech science. When motivated by interesting material and or cool teachers who weren't simply shovelling facts around, but providing meaningful problems, i found I could seriously excel. On the flip side, I never found that I could force myself to master material I could not see any relevance in, unlike a lot of my peers on the more academic tracks in high school who seemed better equipped to be consistent about their studies. A lot of classes particularly moving forward into university felt more like they catered more to people who could bring an innate ability in the subject, than reliably teaching everyone the material. Fortunately for me, my upper level courses tended to be interesting, so I got my undergrad degree, and a job. I've been working in a decent job in a decent, but slow track. Occasionally I have worked on some interesting projects, but for the most part it's work, and pays the bills. I'd love to be in a job I'm totally passionate about, but I don't think throwing the baby out with the bathwater would be a good idea when I don't know what would be better. Financially, I feel like I am on a pretty good footing - I live relatively modestly and invest my savings competently. Social amp Dating - I feel like I was a comparatively normal, albeit shy kid when I was 6- 7. In elementary school, I think I picked up on social stuff later than most, and ended up with virtually no friends or anyone to talk to by late elementary, often very vulnerable to bullying, in a school system which didn't really do anything about it aside from advice to toughen up. As I switched to a high school where virtually no one knew me, I found a place among other geek types, which was something. In college, things were harder for me - classmates were main social circle, not much outside of that. No real dating or prom type stuff to speak of during HS College years. Now, I've got a small social circle with friendships initially developed from work, but as marriages kids get into mix, that kind of group tends to decline over time, and it's hard for someone like me to replace. Now that I'm working, and comparatively less stressed, I periodically try my luck with dating, but for the most part it has been a lot of failures with women who just weren't interested or were unstable and eventually flaked out. I understand the social rituals, and have learned from enough mistakes to have a decent idea of expectations to not prematurely ruin things - I feel like the hard reality is that what I bring to the table isn't that exciting. As someone who feels abnormal in a socially non- acceptable way, and isolated, it's hard for me to feel genuine or accepted, when I know that being honest about my feelings too early is a guaranteed insta- rejection. I don't pretend that dating is easy for most people, but for me it is an absolute tax, with very little prospect of better outcomes unless I can do something about my depression and lack of attractive interests to set me apart in a positive light. Beliefs - I grew up Catholic, dragged to church as a kid teenager until my agnosticism expressed as laziness made my mom eventually give up. I don't see any deity having any role in my life - I describe myself as agnostic. I don't have any objection to people finding comfort in the social support a church organization can provide, but that hasn't really worked for me. If an action can help a person, I don't think society or their own inhibitions should interfere. If anti- depressants or anything else are the ticket to help me get out of my hole, I am certainly open to trying it in past, I've tried Paxil, and later was on Zoloft, with no discernable effects, had been prescribed by GP, not tracked by specialist . Things are not critically bad or getting worse, it's just I've tried a lot of options, and seem to be getting nowhere fast, and life isn't waiting for me to fix this. A big fear for me is that I've got so much baggage holding me back and clouding my experience, I may not be able to notice when I find something that could help. I've started pursuing counselling last fall, but it's hard to make a dent in things.

"I started seeing a psychologist a couple of months ago or so, and Ive been slowly beginning to open up to her. She told me that she wouldnt tell my parents anything unless we agreed on it, or if it was really serious. Until last week, I didnt tell her anything serious. We were talking about something and she made an offhand comment about suicidal thoughts. Then she asked me if I had them, in the sort of tone that implied she was just making sure and that she didnt actually think I would say I did. Except I did, because I do have suicidal thoughts. Even though this is extremely personal, I couldnt lie to her. I would have never brought it up if she hadnt asked me. We talked about it, and then she said that she would have to tell my parents eventually. I really wish she wont. As far as I understand it, shes not going to say anything to my parents unless she thinks Im in danger. Naturally, this means my willingness to share with her has gone down. The problem is, I wanted to tell her that I cut. I came to the meeting last week thinking I was going to tell her. I had gotten to the conclusion that if I told her and she understood I wasnt cutting deep or going to kill my self, she wouldnt tell my parents. I was really hoping that she would ask me if I cut myself. I dont cut very deep, and Im also really not that suicidal. I think I just caught her off guard about it. Despite the fact that I knew that I had suicidal thoughts, I didnt consider them a problem - they had been getting worse, yes, but I dont think Im going to act on them. I need someone to speak with about cutting. Regardless of needing emotional support, I really need some specific information about it.

"So I started becoming self- aware, had suspicions of attention deficit disorder, and organised an appointment to seek professional opinion.

"Now don't get me wrong, I still want to die and cease to exist. I just can't do it to my boyfriend. He loves me very much and has had has his own depression to deal with, so making him go trough my death especially suicide is something I just cannot do to him. On the other hand I can see how it pains and annoys him to see me struggle and I wish I could be the stable, self confident partner he deserves. I have thought about breaking up with him just to let him go on with his life and not be stuck here with me, but I suppose I'm too selfish to do that. I had planned tomorrow carefully and would be prepared to go through with it, quite certainly succeeding if I wanted to. But I think he can sense that something's not right, as hes been super affectionate for the past days. I pretty much have two choices now to actually go through with it or tell him how I feel. But how do you tell something like that though to someone who would quite possibly break into pieces hearing that? Especially as this is something I've felt all through our relationship and way before we even met. How do you tell someone that you've been keeping this massive thing from them for 5 years?","Had planned my suicide carefully for tomorrow , but I do n't think I can do it to my bf .

I use this for the day- to- day stuff like running errands, reminders to call people, etc. What I also like about it is its platform agnostic has client for all major mobile amp desktop operating systems and it hooks into lots of third party services too many to name .

So this is a bit NSFW but I really need advice and want to talk about it. As soon as I started my anti depressants after around 2 or 3 days I started experiencing these Weird things while masturbating. Like it would hurt lot to touch. Or I can barely experience any orgasm at all and I had no clue what was going on. I did some good search and found nothing. It's been 2 months now and I still wasn't sure what was happening I've always been someone with high sex drive and unfortunately It was my escape from feeling depressed too. Just yesterday I was talking to a friend who pointed out how this all started right when I started talking my anti depressants Sertraline. And I Googled it and found out it does affect sex drive and orgasms. I mean It might not seem a big deal to you but like I said It was one of my biggest ways to make myself feel better. Now that I can't do it not only it's extremely frustrating but if also makes me really sad and feel useless especially for my boyfriend. Who doesn't mind it but I do. I'm the one being affected.

"I went to my second therapy session today and the psychologist who is also a psychiatrist went pretty fast to suggesting me to take antidepressants i.e. a SSRI , to feel more stable and reduce my inner stress. There is a chance, that medication could help of course, but during the last months I already made great progress myself, just by writing into my journal and reflecting my thoughts, actions and feelings. Often, I still feel stressed, empty and completely exhausted at the same time, but that is slowly getting better as well. So I'm quite confident, that a talk therapy will work well for me but the psychologist insisted on the necessity of taking meds additionally to the talking part, and that after only two sessions.

"So I have been getting into reddit a bit, and I figure, why not, a lot of good has come from this site for me. I'm sad. About three years ago, my aunt passed away. With this, I became extremely upset, unmotivated, etc. I was in 11th grade at the time, and can remember every aspect of that night. April 10th, 11ish pm, girlfriend was over, parents rushed out of the house, I knew.she had cancer, and it was her time. Anyhow, I went to the school psych, he has helped me through everything. he let me talk, and listened. He knew my older brother before hand aswell also does scheduling and what not Anyway, while my aunt was still sick, he recommended i go see a therapist, talk things out. When I finally did that, it ended up being across the street from the hospital my aunt was in. Didn't phase me much, they asked the normal questions, do i do drugs, do i drink. No to all of them. It was a really unproductive time, they didn't ask anything else, and it just seemed like they wanted me out of there. I dealt with it, from time to time it kicked my ass, but I pushed through. A year later, I am a senior. Time of my life, yet i never wanted to do anything. Kept telling myself something was wrong, ignored myself. College time! Where do I want to go? What do I want to do? well, I didn't care. At all. I was so lost, this life decision in front of me, and i don't even care! Went to school, didn't care about anything. Made a few friends, still didn't care. I failed out, big surprise right? Most days I couldn't pull myself out of bed. Others I didn't do anything at all. Next step of my life, I finally took charge and moved from PA to TX, ""WOAH BIG MOVE! ""you might be saying, well, I had some friends over the internet, two of them married to ea other on was the VP of a his family company, offered me a job. After a while, i took it. After a month down here I decided I made the best decision of my life. I am happy with life finally! Some time goes by, and as happy as I am, I feel the same. Most of the time that issad, lonely, upset. I just don't get it, I have a well paying job, on my own, happy with every aspect, passed the shock of moving out, and everything is going 100 the best it could be for me. I could not ask for anything better, yet i still feel this way. The most random things set it off though, one thing will lead to another, if something upsets me it becomes bigger then it needs to be. I like to think of it like the hulk, make me sad? here is a giant monster inside of you the you cant control. Long story short, I felt that way tonight. Losing some online games, listening to the radio. Sad songs come on, lose some more, get upset, brothers get offline, so i watched a movie under the comedy section. it ended up being a romantic comedy, so let the sadness grow! I get all sappy with them ","So here I am tonight , upset , everything in my life goes right , and I feel like i do n't deserve it , and sometimes I wish things would go wrong so I have an excuse to be upset .

"Just came across this subreddit and decided that I want to stop smoking today. I'm a 19 year old college student and I believe that I live a pretty good life, but my anxiety has been getting worse during this past year and I think I've started getting panic attacks I used to only get nervous to this extent for things like presentations and interviews, but now I'm getting super nervous even for small social gatherings I've always been an a bit of an anxious person and worry about things a lot especially when it comes to school grades , but my anxiety has really magnified over this past year.

"Some background information My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasn't a bad break- up, just a sad one. Shortly after the break- up, I noticed I wasn't dealing with it well at all. I couldn't do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder MDD . I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldn't do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasn't angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her I'm okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest. At this point I have accepted she won't talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In March April she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it. So far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder PDD so a double depression , and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder e.g. avoidant, dependent, anti- social, existential OCD . I am still at the early stages so I won't have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the break- up. Still, my ex thinks she and the break- up are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she won't speak to me nor believe me. amp Now here is my dilemma I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown man's body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life won't get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I don't see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesn't make me happy. I don't even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say ""Move on! "", ""Man up! "", ""Do this or do that , I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. It's not even that I don't want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but it's like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know it's the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee I'll get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And don't get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesn't do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward won't make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing won't make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel it's the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself that it is my responsibility but I cannot do it anymore. I am hopeless, desperate, and dysfunctional What can I still possibly do?! Call me anything you want, swear at me, tell me I am a pussy, call me cringy, give me those hard truths again. Do it if you want.

"Fragmented. Thats the exact word Ive used in the past when trying to get people to understand how my memory works. It perplexes me, I dont even know how to explain it because its so seemingly disorganized and chaotic. Its like my timeline isnt linear. I have very little concept of days, weeks, months and years. Times of day are actually becoming more difficult for me to remember as well, which is kinda freaking me out. My memory has been strange troublesome for as long as I can remember. When I was young, I was forgetful short term and my memory was foggy but I think it was kind of linear. As time went by though, it gradually got less and less linear. Its fragmented. Thats the best word Ive been able to come up with. Something that feels like just a few days ago might have been weeks or months ago. More often than not, though, times that just happened seem so far in the past. I forget so easily what happened once the day is behind me. I focus on today, every day. This causes significant problems for me including missing appointments and forgetting to text and call people back. It hurts my case in arguments because I cant trust my memory nor come up with a counter- argument to defend myself when events are involved for example when have I ever said that? Or give me an example of a time I did that? Etc. . Its so goddamn frustrating and I feel so helpless sometimes. I feel like Im missing a vital part of my cognition. Another huge aspect of fragmentation that comes to mind is the fact that I have an immense amount of trouble with seeing the big picture. Take learning a new card game, for instance. I try to follow along with the instructions as its explained before we start. I understand one sentence, and then I understand the second, but I cant seem to put them together and see how theyre related. I barely even remember the first sentence once the second ones been said. I cant string the pieces together cause I keep losing the damn strings. I have a hell of a time seeing things as a whole. I cant sum up very many things. I usually cant tell you the general theme of anything, like the average mood I had this week, or the vibe of a specific neighbourhood, or how busy we were at work this week. I feel so broken. I feel like Im missing something vital that is supposed to help me connect to other people, and function properly in social settings. I generally avoid learning new games when Im at parties or family get- togethers. Cause if I do join, its stressful and embarrassing for me. People explain things and I just cant for the life of me understand their explanations and instructions. I can learn and memorize it eventually if we play it a lot like maybe a few hours. But not even close to as fast as regular people can. I feel sad when I think about it, I dont know why this is happening to me. I used to be the smartest kid in class back in elementary school. I was always called bright and a quick learner. There are many things I have committed to memory such as song lyrics and games Im already familiar with. However, most of what I have memorized pre- dates the dramatic decline of my memory grade 8 and earlier it started in grade 9 and has gotten rapidly worse . Memory issues have made me far less stressed out, that is the one good aspect. I live pretty much in the moment. I dont let very much affect my mood cause it all goes away anyway so whats the point? Lol, weird but true But its not worth the impairment of my social skills and social life, my ability to learn, my ability to relate events and analyze patterns, formulate plans, etc. Its not worth it. Im actually really scared. It just gets worse and worse. Ive had hallucinations in the past one visual about 8- 9 years ago, one auditory around the same time, auditory about two years ago, tactile about 6 months ago. Im scared that all these cognitive issues are a sign that Ill soon be experiencing psychosis again I have delusions already, though, which leads to paranoia . What if I start hearing voices and seeing things that arent there? What if my brain completely deteriorates? I have soooooo many different symptoms of all types, its unbelievable. I miss how things were 8- 10 years ago, back when all I really had was depression and anxiety, and some OCD tendencies. Now Im a fucking mess. Im really hoping Ill be okay","I feel like my brain is fragmented because my memory timeline is nt linear , and my cognition is too poor for me to understand things easily . I m scared that I m developing schizophrenia . I have all the symptoms except hallucinations but have had them in the past . My experiences right now are heavily correlated with the prodromal phase of schizophrenia , and I m scared that s where I m headed . I also mourn for the life that mental illness has taken from me","I feel like my memory is fragmented. I ca nt remember what happened to me in the past. I have no concept of days, weeks, months and years. I do nt know why this is happening to me. I feel like I m missing a vital part of my cognition that is supposed to help me connect to other people, and function properly in social settings. I m scared I m going to be experiencing psychosis soon.","My memory is getting worse and worse. I ca nt remember things as easily as I used to. I have no idea what s going on with my brain and I feel like I m losing my ability to connect with other people, and function properly in social situations. I m scared that I m going to experience psychosis soon and I do nt know how to deal with it.","My memory is fragmented. It s like my timeline is nt linear. I have a hard time seeing the big picture. I ca nt string the pieces together and see things as a whole. I can memorize things quickly but not as fast as regular people.

"tw self harm, suicidal thoughts amp i've kind of disconnected myself from everyone. not intentionally, but i keep getting worse and worse. more tired, more like i don't care what happens to me anymore. i feel numb most of the time, unless i'm talking to my boyfriend. he makes me feel alive, happy even. like i'm maybe not alone, like maybe everything will be okay. but the minute he hangs up the call, or as soon as he leaves after spending the day, and maybe even the night with me, everything comes back. i'm either sad or numb. everything inside me tells me i'm not good enough. i'm not smart enough, not pretty enough, but just not enough. he started uni today, and i'm happy for him that he feels like he's doing something worthwhile because he started cutting after feeling like he wasn't doing anything while everyone around him was , but it just scares me. i got used to spending a lot more time with him over the past few months after school ended, and now he's going to be more busy again, and i'll see him less and less, and if i don't have him, what am i? over the christmas break, i broke my 5 month self harm clean streak, and i feel horrible, and i've also had pretty regular suicidal thoughts. i've been hating my body more again too, but that's a whole other thing. i just felt like i could talk to him about this, but now that i know that he started cutting i don't want to anymore, and with uni, i just don't want to stress him out. my therapist is off work for a few weeks too because her dad died, so i pretty much have no one. i can talk to my best friend, but it's way better talking to my boyfriend. even though she sort of gets it, i just feel more comfortable talking to my boyfriend about this somehow. so yeah. i don't know what to do. i just feel alone and left behind. i'm tired and scared, and i'm just sick of trying to hold it all together. amp","my boyfriend started uni which means we 'll have less time together , and i feel alone without him . my self harm and suicidal thoughts are coming back , and i do n't want to talk to him about it because he 's going through this too , and i do n't want to trigger him , or stress him out because he 'll already have so much to do because of uni . i ca n't talk to my therapist , she 's off work for a few weeks because her dad died , and i just feel alone , and numb and sad . i do n't have anyone i can talk to about this","i'm depressed and suicidal, and i don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about it, because i'm scared he's going to be more busy with uni and i 'll see him less and less.","i feel like i'm not good enough for anyone, and i don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about it. i feel more comfortable talking to my best friend, but it's not the same as talking to someone else.","i've disconnected myself from everyone except my boyfriend, and now that he's starting uni, i'm going to see him less and less, and i don't want to stress him out. i've been self harming again, and have also been having suicidal thoughts. i feel like i can't talk to my therapist about this because she's on vacation, and my best friend isn't in town for a few weeks.",0.34437086092715236,0.1476510067114094,0.2649006622516556,0.2967741935483871,0.11764705882352942,0.2193548387096774,0.5425531914893618,0.23655913978494625,0.2978723404255319
"My biggest issue of late is life just seems pointless to continue, but I don't have the courage in lack of better words to end it. I just stay alive to not put others through that type of pain because of guilt issues, among other reasons. I am 28, 29 in two months, unemployed, associates degree in liberal arts waste of my time and money , and live at home since I wasted all the money I ever earned pretty much. Now I know I could turn my life around probably but I don't know where to start. It's going to take so many years to make save enough to support myself and either due to one of my mental conditions major depression, general and social anxiety disorder are diagnosed, but recently I've gotten to where I rarely leave my house one or twice a month, have paranoid delusions, and struggle to see s point in living in the system that we have no choice but to play. My old therapist would say excuses I can hear her now, heh I've had drug problems for years now, although they've gotten tamer over the years. I am pretty sure amphetamines caused the paranoia and a in lack of better phrasing 'craziness'. I will generally finish s bottle equalling 1200mg in two- three weeks, suffer, maybe take some benzos if I have spares but that's rarer these days because I've sadly abused them more the I had been once or twice a week now because of the loneliness since my best friend overdosed in February. What's fucked up is I'm aware I'm doing what not to do, but just can't find a reason to care, in all likeliness I won't lead a great life even if I do manage to start functioning in society again. I basically gave up dating since I basically go completely dumb around women and either won't talk of trip over my words. I'm not successful anyways besides I guess at being a drug addict and I'm broke so why would anyone want me anyways. Even when I wasn't using years ago I have yet to have an actual girlfriend although I've had sex, which was kind of a let down knowing they are going to forget about me within a day. I see myself living in a low income area barely scraping by and if I could afford it probably move on to heroin or something was an opiate addict for a while so I know what I'm signing up for with that , I mean right now I don't intend to, but if I'm alone the rest of my life with my friends dying or growing apart because they figured out this whole adulthood thing, combined with a shitty job I hate, why not? Sorry for the rant and the illogical and stupid comments in this post. I just don't really know who to talk to, and even worse, I can't afford good help plus I feel so defeated I don't even know if I care anymore, although I must somewhat if I'm still alive. I really miss my friend, he was the only person who shared most if not all my conditions and he was like my little brother. My current friends are seeming to be more responsible and make good life decisions and all my stories are about debauchery and bad decisions. Sometimes I don't know what to talk about anymore. I'd love a romantic partner but I don't see it happening, especially since I rarely go anywhere or try at all","I 've reached a point where my depression is almost apathy , I see no point in living this horrible incurable existence just for other people , but I love them too much to off myself . So I sit here in limbo just taking it each day at a time and lying to myself along with self medicating with marijuana at least , amphetamines or benzos depending on what I have currently . I do n't see a point in getting clean , I feel I fucked up so much that it 's stupid to try , and romantically no woman would possibly want me due to my substance abuse , mental instability , and general lack of any type of financial security . What 's the fucking point anymore ?","I'm 28, 29 in two months, unemployed, don't know what to do with my life, can't afford good help, have no friends, no romantic partner, no job, no money, no girlfriend, and no reason to live. I'm not suicidal, but I do nt know if I 'll ever be able to turn my life around.","I don't know what to do with my life, I feel like I'm wasting my life and I've lost all the progress I made in the past few years. I 'd love to hear if anyone has any advice on how to get out of this rut.","I'm 28, 29, unemployed, drug addict, alcoholic, depressed, paranoid, have no social life, don't see a point in living in a world where we have no choice but to live and struggle to see a reason to continue living. I'm aware I could turn my life around, but I just can't find the motivation to do so. I feel like I 'll be alone the rest of my life with my friends growing up and getting married and having kids while I stay home and do nothing but drink and smoke pot.

"Hey guys, this is a throwaway account since for personal reasons. So my name is Jake and i have a disability which is a speech impediment called Verbal Apraxia of speech with Stuttering . I am 25 years old and i work for a MMJ dispensary while i'm in mortuary school to become a Funeral Director. Im writing this post since i have severe anxiety with some Depression about my disability. My speech is only affected by the Verbal Apraxia with stuttering so it means that i sound like a retart with stuttering. I missed so many opportunities in my life compared to everyone in my life such my twin brother, my cousins, everyone because i never went to away to college like everyone else i only stayed at community college before mortuary school because i didn't get good enough grades in HS due to my Anxiety Depression so i didn't get to join a frat meet girls at parties etc. The mortuary school is online too so im stuck at home of the time studying besides working 1 day a week at the MMJ Dispensary with my mom and Twin Brother if they are there on that day my mom mostly since she's the head pharmacist . I have had 1- 4 anxiety attacks at work in the last few months because all of this.I almost never drink too bc the hangovers make my anxiety worse. I think that i will never find a girlfriend because i sound like a retart because of my speech impediments. I suck talking to girls too unlike everyone in this day and age. I barely talk to my friends anymore due to my Anxiety and depression over the last few months. Im tired of seeing my cousins, people from HS, twin brother getting into relationships and getting married while im sitting in my moms house studying at 25 and not meeting people . People have said my speech Impediments ranged from sounding deaf to having a heavy accent. When i talk to girls at work , when they don't understand me, they look at me like i have 20 heads and then i feel like crying and fleeing the sense because i think how can not a girl date a guy like me with my speech impediments sounding like a retart and all of this shit in my own head. I lost all of my muscles from wrestling and football in HS MS due to my Anxiety depression over the last 6- 8 years. Also i used tinder which my twin brother met his girlfriend on and have no luck even after many dates with different girls, now i am getting more depressed to the point of crying everyday puking everyday, feeling sick from the all the Anxiety depression. I told everything to my family and some people that i trust in my life about all of this too.also i saw a therapist before too on and off. i told everything to My mom my twin brother and some trusted people in my life what about im thinking for years now and they say now i need to grow up because my speech is not as bad as i make it out to be and i need to try more in school and stuff. They said that i will find someone and stuff but its taking forever while everyone is getting married etc. Plus i think im ugly too since i have like no muscles at 5'11 and at 138 pounds i signed up for a gym before covid came , i think im not attractive but i have been told different by people in my life that im attractive . I am almost crying and feeling like throwing up too as i wrote this. I barely eat or sleep right anymore really too. i don't know what to do right now, at this point because this is going on for many years now and i can't take getting treated differently by people and especially girls too","i have Verbal Apraxia with stuttering which are speech impediments and i ca n't talk to girls due to the fear of not being understood and rejected of my speech impediments . I m scared of being forever alone while everyone my is going to get married and have kids in a few years while I 'm not . To be honest , I 'm almost 100 sure most girls will not date me because of my speech impediments and have a family . What should i do at this point in time ? Also should i try to approach and talk to girls that i like ? Thanks for everything !
